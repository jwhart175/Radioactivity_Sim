#B           The |b- spectrum has been studied (1964Sh21, 1966Da06, and   
#B      1966Fu05) to determine the energies and intensities. The data     
#B      from the singles spectrum lacks uniqueness due to high density    
#B      of possible final states. In particular, the highest energy       
#B      component [E{-|b-}=1350 {I30} (1964Sh21), 1340 {I100}             
#B      (1966Da06), and 1300 {I20} (1966Fu05)] may be a combination of    
#B      branches feeding levels at 0, 54, 63, and even 115 keV. The most  
#B      detailed set of measured values are the coincidence results of    
#B      1964Sh21.  These data yield a Q value of |? 1340 {I30} compared   
#B      with the mass-adjustment value of 1363 {I5} (2003Au03). The |b-   
#B      intensities are even less unique, but 1966Da06 and 1966Fu05       
#B      agree that there are major groups with energies of |? 1340 and    
#B      |? 910 keV with an intensity ratio 0.89 (1966Da06) or 1.15        
#B      (1966Fu05).                                                       
#B E         The values given include both those calculated from the      
#B      Q value and the measured values.                                  
#B IB        Values are from |g intensity balances and assume no |b-      
#B      feeding of the ground state. Beta branches similar to this        
#B      ground-state transition [i.e., 5/2[413] to                        
#B      3/2[521]] have log {Ift} values of 7.8-8.7. In this {+157}Eu      
#B      |b- decay, this range corresponds to I{-|b-}(0)=1-10%. The        
#B      measured values of 1966Da06 and 1966Fu05 for two major |b-        
#B      groups are given in comments and they agree well with the         
#B      deduced values.                                                   
#B IB        Values of <1% are omitted since the lack of completeness     
#B      of the decay scheme makes them unreliable. The sum of the I|b-    
#B      values given is 101% {I9}, and the sum of all the positive,       
#B      computed values is 105% {I9}.                                     
#G           The data are from 1986GrZS (private communication) unless    
#G      otherwise noted, including E{-|g}, I{-|g}, and coincidences in    
#G      drawing. Less extensive sets of values are given by 1966Fu05      
#G      and 1966Da06 which include ce data. Others: 1964Sh12, 1965CaZZ,   
#G      and 1969Gr32.                                                     
#G           The unplaced |g's are from 1986GrZS from |g measurements     
#G      and 1966Ha23 from ce measurements.

#L      whose placement is in question. The reduced-|h{+2} for this
