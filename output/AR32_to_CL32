#  2008Bh08: {+32}Ar produced in the reaction {+9}Be({+36}Ar,X) with a    
#  100 MeV/nucleon beam at NSCL. A1200 fragment separator.                
#  53.28 MeV/nucleon {+32}Ar beam implanted in a P/N silicon detector.    
#  Measured E|g, I|g, delayed protons, p|g coin using HPGe detectors      
#  (3 four-fold segmented clovers and 2 monolithic crystals) and          
#  silicon detectors. The {Ift} value of T=2, superallowed transition     
#  from 0+ parent state of {+32}Ar to 0+ excited state at 5246 keV in     
#  {+32}Cl was determined.                                                
#  Absolute intensities of proton groups measured from the determination  
#  of total number of implanted {+32}Ar ions and detector efficiencies.   
#  S(p)({+32}Cl)=1581.3 {I6} (2008Bh08), from energy of the IAS at 5046.4 
#  keV in {+32}Cl and E(c.m.)=3465.0 {I4} (from ISOLDE data yet to be     
#  published) for total kinetic energy of                                 
#  proton group and {+31}S level energy in the superallowed decay.        
#  2003Au03 give S(p)({+32}Cl)=1574 {I7}                                  
#  From this experiment 2008Bh08 deduced isospin symmetry breaking        
#  correction in {+32}Ar decay |d{-C}{+exp}=2.1% {I8}.                    
#  2008Bh08 use some of the results from ISOLDE experiment (reference 10  
#  in their paper) which are expected to appear in a future publication   
#  2006BoZZ is from the same group as 2008Bh08                            
#  1985BJ01: E=600 MEV protons on ^CaO target producing 32AR through      
#  spallation. Mass separated through ^ISOLDE-^I. Measured half-life,     
#  ^Ep, E|g, ^Ip, I|g, p|b|g coincidences, branching ratio. Proton        
#  energies measured using silicon detectors; germanium detector for      
#  |g-rays.                                                               
#  1993SC16: E=600 MEV protons on ^Ca^O target producing 32AR through     
#  spallation. Mass separated through ^ISOLDE-^II. Measured ^Ep and ^Ip   
#  using ^Si detector.

#  2007DoZX: Measured proton energies and intensities of 19 groups        
#  at GANIL facility, p|g coin. The protons range from 594.1 to 6056      
#  keV. Most of these groups are in agreement with those from 2008Bh08    
#  and earlier studies. However, one severe discrepancy is noted that     
#  1203.7-keV proton group is shown to be in coin with a 2230-keV |g ray  
#  (presumably corresponding to known 2236|g in {+31}S), but in 2008Bh08, 
#  this proton group was observed strongly in coin with 1248|g from the   
#  first excited state of {+31}S. Moreover the deduced level excitation   
#  energy quoted by 2007DoZX as 6295 for the 1203.7 proton group seems    
#  to be in error if this group is in coin with 2236|g. In view of        
#  the lack of sufficient details in 2007DoZX and noted inconsistencies,  
#  the evaluators feel that it is premature to consider data from         
#  2007DoZX for current evaluation.
