#  {+252}Cf source placed between two 10 mg/cm{+2} iron foils to stop     
#  fission fragments and surrounded by a plastic ball to absorb |b-rays   
#  and conversion electrons. Gamma rays detected by the Gammasphere array 
#  at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. {+115}Rh events identified   
#  by relative intensities and coincidences with transitions of the       
#  complementary fragments {+133-135}I. Data analyzed with                
#  RADWARE software package. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g coincidence.         
#  Deduced levels, J, |p, and branching ratios. Comparison with rigid     
#  triaxial rotor plus particle (RTRP) model. Systematics of odd-A        
#  Rh isotopes discussed.
