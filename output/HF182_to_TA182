#  2004Ah10: {+182}Hf source was the one originally produced by           
#  1971He13. measured E|g, I|g, |g|g with a 25% Ge detector and           
#  a low energy photon spectrometer (LEPS).                               
#  1971He13: {+182}Hf sources produced by irradiation of natural Hf and   
#  enriched {+180}Hf with neutrons followed by chemical separation after  
#  a waiting period of about two years. One sample was also               
#  mass separated. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g using

#G E$From 2004Ah10. Corresponding values from 1971He13 are in             
#G agreement but somewhat less precise.                                   
#G RI$ From 2004Ah10 who measured absolute intensities (photons/100       
#G decays of the parent) were measured by two methods. The first          
#G involved a counting arrangement with low absolute efficiencies and the 
#G other is to use a system where one can measure and account for         
#G the summing effect. Corresponding values from 1971He13 are in          
#G agreement but somewhat less precise.
