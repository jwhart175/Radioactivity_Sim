#  2000Sa21, 2001Sa72: {+43}S was produced by fragmentation of {+48}Ca    
#  beam at 60 MeV/nucleon on a tantalum target. Measured magnetic rigidity
#  of particles to deduce mass, TOF measurements, |DE-E measurement       
#  with an array of four-element silicon detector telescope. Delayed      
#  |g-rays measured with 4|p NaI array surrounding the detector           
#  telescope. Precision mass measurement is reported                      
#  in addition to a new isomer in {+43}S. Delayed coincidence was         
#  measured using two Ge detectors and a Si telescope.                    
#  2009Ga05: E=60 MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca beam was produced at GANIL.         
#  Fragments were separated by the LISE-2000 spectrometer. A 50 |mm thick 
#  plastic scintillator at the focal plane was used for g factor          
#  measurement using the Time Dependent Perturbed Angular Distribution    
#  (TDPAD); four coaxial Ge detectors for |g detection. Measured E|g, g   
#  factor. Comparison with various calculations such as                   
#  shell-model, particle+rotor model, generator coordinate                
#  method (GCM), and Gaussian overlap approximation (GOA).                
#  2012Ka36: {+43}S was produced by Be({+238}U,F|g) with E=345 MeV/nucleon
#  {+238}U beam from the RIBF accelerator at RIKEN on a Be target. Fission
#  fragments were separated and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported
#  to focal plane of ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an  
#  aluminum stopper. Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r  
#  method. Delayed |g-rays from microsecond isomers were detected by      
#  three clover-type HPGe detectors (FWHM=2.1 keV at 1 MeV). Measured E|g,
#  I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer half-life. Deduced level. Comparison with       
#  previous studies.
