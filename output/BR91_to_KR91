#B           1989Gr03 measured B- endpoint energies for                   
#B B- decay to 13 levels (from Fermi-Kurie analysis of G-gated B          
#B spectra;  details are given in comments for relevant levels). From     
#B these data, 1989Gr03 deduce Q(|b-)=9790 100. 1992GrZX report           
#B Q(|b-)=9805 50, also from GB coin.

#G Eleven more lines with EG>2500 are identified in the
