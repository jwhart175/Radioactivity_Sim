#  1995OZ02: ^A BEAM OF 19C IONS WAS PRODUCED BY FRAGMENTING A 22NE BEAM  
#  ON A 9BE TARGET. THE BEAM WAS MAGNETICALLY SEPARATED, DEGRADED TO      
#  LOWER ENERGIES, AND FINALLY STOPPED IN A PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR.         
#  THE IMPLANTATION DETECTOR WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN FOUR OTHER            
#  SCINTILLATOR                                                           
#  DETECTORS, AND A VALID EVENT REQUIRED A COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THREE      
#  AJACENT DETECTORS. THREE NEUTRON WALLS SURROUNDED THE IMPLANTATION     
#  TARGET AND COVERED ABOUT 1.4 SR. THE DECAY NEUTRON ENERGY WAS          
#  DEDUCED BY THE TIME OF FLIGHT BETWEEN THE IMPLANTATION DETECTOR AND    
#  THE NEUTRON WALL DETECTORS. THE ^ToF WAS CALIBRATED BY STUDYING THE    
#  DECAY OF 17N WHICH HAS THREE VISIBLE KNOWN NEUTRON GROUPS.             
#  A SET OF TWO NAI DETECTORS ALSO FACED THE TARGET FOR USE MEASURING     
#  GAMMA-RAY SINGLES EVENTS AND N-GAMMA COINCIDENCE EVENTS.               
#       THE MEASURED NEUTRON SPECTRUM SHOWS SEVERAL DECAY GROUPS. A       
#  SIGNIFICANT 17B COMPONENT WAS PRESENT IN THE BEAM, AND ITS DECAY       
#  RADIATIONS PRESENTED A BACKGROUND THAT WAS ANALYZED AND SUBTRACTED.    
#  THE FINAL ANALYSIS OF THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM REVEALED FIVE        
#  NEUTRON GROUPS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO BETA DELAYED NEUTRON DECAY OF    
#  19C, OR ITS DAUGHTER 19N.                                              
#  THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT, IONS WERE IMPLANTED FOR A 100 MS PERIOD     
#  FOLLOWED BY A 200 MS COUNTING PERIOD; ANALYSIS OF THE TIME DEPENDENCE  
#  FOR THE NEUTRON GROUPS PERMITTED ASSIGNMENT OF FOUR GROUPS TO DECAY    
#  OF 19C (T AP 50 MS) AND ONE GROUP TO DECAY OF 19N (T AP 320 MS).       
#  FOUR NEUTRON GROUPS AT E{-N}=0.46, 1.01, 1.50 AND 2.08 ARE OBSERVED;   
#  POOR STATISTICS PROHIBITED FULL ANALYSIS OF THE E{-N}=2.08 MEV GROUP.
