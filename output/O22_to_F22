#  1989Hu07: Source produced by Be({+40}Ar,x) E=60 MeV/A, mass separated  
#  by LISE mass spectrometer.  HPGe, |g|g and |b|g coincidences.          
#  2005We06: Mass separated {+12}C{+22}O molecular beam from the ISOLDE   
#  facility; {+22}O obtained from fission of uranium by 1.4 GeV protons.  
#  Measured  E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g coin using Ge detector for |g rays and  
#  plastic scintillator for |b rays.

#G RI$From 1989Hu07, except otherwise noted. Intensity not corrcted for   
#G summing in 1989Hu07. 2005We06 corrected intensity for summing from     
#G simulation, applicable for 2499G (1862.6G + 637.4G). Reported          
#G intensities in 1989Hu07 and 2005We06 are statistically consistent.
