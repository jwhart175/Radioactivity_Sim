#  2014Pa55: {+164}Sm produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,F),E=345 MeV/nucleon     
#  reaction at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory (RIBF) at RIKEN           
#  accelerator laboratory. Nuclei were separated in terms of              
#  mass-to-charge (A/q) ratio and atomic number Z using BigRIPS and       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometers. Ions of {+164}Sm were implanted in a         
#  copper passive stopper, and the gamma rays from the isomer were        
#  detected using Euroball-RIKEN Cluster array (EURICA) consisting of     
#  84 HPGe crystals in a 4|p configuration. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, 
#  (ion implants)|g correlations, delayed-gamma-ray spectroscopy, isomer  
#  half-life. Deduced levels, J, |p, multipolarity. Comparison with       
#  potential energy surface calculations including |b{-6} deformation     
#G M$As implied from transition intensity balances and |DJ|p. These are   
#G not given explicitly in 2014Pa55                                       
#L E$From least-squares fit to E|g data, assuming energy of the first     
#L 2+ level at 69 keV {I1} from rotational band systematics of nuclei     
#L in this mass region                                                    
#L J$As proposed by 2014Pa55 based on systematics of even-even nuclides   
#L for low-lying levels and potential-energy surface calculations for     
#L higher levels above 1 MeV, supported by multipolarities obtained from  
#L intensity balances.                                                    
#L BAND(A)$The g.s. band.                                                 
#L Calculations suggest |b{-2}=0.301, |b{-4}=0.030, |b{-6}=-0.023 for     
#L the ground state
