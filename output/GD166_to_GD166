#  2014Pa55: {+166}Gd produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,F),E=345 MeV/nucleon     
#  reaction at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory (RIBF) at RIKEN           
#  accelerator laboratory. Nuclei were separated in terms of              
#  mass-to-charge (A/q) ratio and atomic number Z using BigRIPS and       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometers. Ions of {+166}Gd were implanted in a         
#  copper passive stopper, and the gamma rays from the isomer were        
#  detected using Euroball-RIKEN Cluster array (EURICA) consisting of     
#  84 HPGe crystals in a 4|p configuration. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, 
#  (ion implants)|g correlations, delayed-gamma-ray spectroscopy, isomer  
#  half-life. Deduced levels, J, |p, multipolarity. Comparison with       
#  potential energy surface calculations including |b{-6} deformation     
#G E(X),RI(X)$The |g ray seen in |g|g-coin spectrum, not in (ion)|g       
#G correlated spectrum. Intensity is obtained from transition intensity   
#G balances at relevant levels and theoretical internal conversion        
#G coefficients                                                           
#G E(W)$Weak |g ray. This |g ray does not belong to lower-mass isotopes   
#G with one, two or three electrons (H-, He- or Li-like) as shown by the  
#G known |g-ray data for these isotopes                                   
#G M$As implied from transition intensity balances and |DJ|p. These are   
#G not given explicitly in 2014Pa55.                                      
#G M(Y)$Dominant M1 according to e-mail reply of Jan 22, 2015 from one    
#G of the authors (Z. Podolyak) of 2014Pa55, and that small E2 admixture  
#G is possible                                                            
#G CC$Value overlaps M1 and E2 when |d(E2/M1) is not given for            
#G mult=(M1(+E2))                                                         
#L E$From least-squares fit to E|g data                                   
#L J$As proposed by 2014Pa55 based on systematics of even-even nuclides   
#L for low-lying levels and potential-energy surface calculations for     
#L higher levels above 1 MeV, supported by multipolarities obtained from  
#L intensity balances.                                                    
#L BAND(A)$The g.s. band.                                                 
#L Calculations suggest |b{-2}=0.296, |b{-4}=0.015, |b{-6}=-0.020 for     
#L ground state
