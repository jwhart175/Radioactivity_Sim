#  2009Il01, 2009Wi03: {+77}Cu isotope produced in the reaction           
#  {+238}U(p,F) with a 50 MeV beam provided by the HRIBF facility at      
#  ORNL, RIB facility. The radioactive beams were extracted and mass      
#  separated. Detected decay products with a Micro-channel plate detector,
#  an ionization chamber and a moving tape collector.                     
#  In one experiment, the Cu ions were accelerated to 225 MeV and         
#  measured |b-delayed neutron emission probabilities.                    
#  In a second experiment, the low-energy ions (200 keV) were sent to     
#  Low-energy Radioactive Ion Beam Spectroscopy Station (LeRIBSS).        
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |b, |g|g, |b|g coin,  absolute branching ratios in  
#  {+77}Cu |b decay and  772.4-keV (1/2-) isomer in {+77}Zn, half-life of 
#  {+77}Cu g.s. using two plastic |b-detectors and |g-rays with four      
#  clover Ge detectors. 2009Gr06 is from the same group as 2009Wi03       
#  2009Pa35: {+77}Cu produced in the fission of uranium (target=uranium   
#  carbide) by spallation neutrons which were produced by 1 GeV protons   
#  hitting a tantalum target. The {+77}Cu nuclei were selected by         
#  Resonant Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) and General Purpose       
#  mass separator (GPS) at the CERN-ISOLDE facility. The separated        
#  {+77}Cu nuclei at a typical energy of 60 keV were implanted on a tape  
#  surrounded by three E-|DE plastic detectors for |b-particle detection  
#  and two HPGe detectors. Measured |g, |b, |b|g coin, |b|b coin,         
#  |g|g coin and delayed-neutron events. The neutrons were detected with  
#  the Mainz neutron long counter. Major contribution to |g-ray and       
#  |b spectra are from {+77}Ga decay as indicated by a comparison of      
#  'laser-on' and 'laser-off' spectra. In both the spectra, lines from    
#  {+77}Ga are quite prominent. The decay scheme of {+77}Ga is poorly     
#  known. By subtraction procedures, 2009Pa35 obtained a spectrum         
#  which mainly contained lines from {+77}Cu activity. In the presence    
#  of the impurities, singles |b spectrum could not be obtained, thus     
#  no information could be obtained for |b feeding to the ground state    
#  and the 772-keV isomeric state                                         
#  All data are from 2009Il01, unless otherwise stated. The level         
#  schemes are proposed by 2009Il01 and 2009Pa35, more complete           
#  in the former work, thus adopted here                                  
#  Total decay energy of 7231 keV {I320} deduced (by RADLIST code) from   
#  proposed decay scheme is much lower than the expected value of         
#  10490 keV {I500}, indicating that decay scheme is incomplete           
#B IB,LOGFT$ The |b feedings are from |g-ray intensity balance at each    
#B level, unless otherwise stated. All |b feedings are considered as      
#B upper limits and associated log| {Ift} values as lower limits since    
#B some |g rays may be below the detection limit of this experiment.      
#G $ Values of relative |g-ray intensities from |b-delayed neutron decay  
#G to {+76}Zn from 2009Il01 are: 100.2 {I9} for 598.56 {I5} |g to first   
#G 2+ level and 2.89 {I11} for 697.72 {I8} |g to first 4+ level in        
#G {+76}Zn. Corresponding value in 2009Pa35 is 89 {I3} for 598.3 {I3} |g  
#G E,RI$ From 2009Il01. Values from 2009Pa35 are in general agreement     
#G but less precise                                                       
#G E(D)$ Assigned to {+77}Cu decay based on half-life. It could not       
#G be placed in the level scheme due to lack of |g|g coin data            
#G E(X)$ Transition without strong coincidence evidence and/or other      
#G linking transitions                                                    
#L J,T$ From Adopted Levels, based on systematics, decay pattern          
#L and |b feedings                                                        
#L E$ From least-square fit to E|g data. Due to poor fit                  
#L in the level scheme, 2118.8|g from 2235 level was not included in      
#L the fitting procedure
