#  Assignment: chemical and mass separation of fission                    
#  fragments from {+235}U(n,F) and U(|g,F).                               
#  Measured: T{-1/2}, E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin.

#B IB        The intensities of the |b-branches were calculated from      
#B I(|g+ce)-imbalances at each level, with M1 internal conversion         
#B taken into account. M1 was chosen  for nuclear structure reasons and   
#B and also looking to intensity balances. However as the multipolarities 
#B have not been measured experimentally no absolute intensities are given
#G M         The assumption of M1 multipolarity for all |g-rays           
#G is extensively discussed by 1980De06                                   
#G E(A)      The sequence of these |g-rays may be reversed.
