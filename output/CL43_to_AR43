#  2006Wi10: {+43}Cl isotope produced by fragmentation of a {+48}Ca beam  
#  at 70 MeV/nucleon hitting a {+9}Be target. The fragments were          
#  separated by A1200 fragment separator at NSCL, MSU facility.           
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b, |b|g coin using two Ge detectors for      
#  |g-rays and a plastic scintillator for |b-rays. Comparisons with       
#  shell-model calculations

#B $There is a total of 28% {I10} unidentified |b feeding (2006Wi10).     
#B Up to 8% can be associated with feeding to the ground state.           
#B It is possible that some of the unidentified feeding is associated     
#B with |b-delayed neutron decay of {+43}Cl
