#  1978Hu10: {+43}Ar isotopes were produced in the spallation reaction    
#  {+50}V(p,6pxn) with the proton beam from the 600 MeV external beam of  
#  the CERN synchrocyclotron bombarding a vanadium carbide target.        
#  Argon nuclides were separated in the ISOLDE on-line mass separator.    
#  |g-rays were detected in Ge(Li) detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g.    
#  Deduced levels, branching ratios. See also 1970Hu11.

#  All data from 1978Hu10 unless otherwise noted.                         
#  The decay scheme is considered incomplete in view of no uncertainties  
#  available on |g-ray intensities. Thus all |b feedings and log| {Ift}   
#  values are considered as approximate. In Adopted dataset, log| {Ift}   
#  have been used but the J|p based on these are considered as tentative
