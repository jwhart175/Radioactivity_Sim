#  {+62}Cr produced in fragmentation of {+76}Ge{+30+} beam on a {+58}Ni   
#  target. LISE3 doubly achromatic spectrometer used to separate          
#  fragments, with magnetic rigidity tuned to optimize transmission of    
#  {+62}V and {+64}Cr fragments.  Transmitted nuclei were identified by   
#  three consecutive Si detectors (300, 300 and 1500 microns); first two  
#  served for energy loss and time-of-flight measurements, while the last 
#  determined their residual energies.                                    
#  Measured E|g, I|g, I|b, |g|g, |b|g coin., |g(t), lifetimes with four   
#  Ge detectors placed around a thick Si telescope. Half-lives determined 
#  by fitting procedure involving five parameters: half-lives of mother,  
#  daughter and grand-daughter nuclei, the |b-efficiency and the          
#  background rate over the counting time.                                
#  All data are from 2005Ga01, unless otherwise stated                    
#  The decay scheme is poorly known                                       
#  Total decay energy of 1140 keV {I3} deduced (by RADLIST code) from     
#  proposed decay scheme is much lower than the expected value of         
#  7770 keV {I340}, indicating that decay scheme is incomplete
