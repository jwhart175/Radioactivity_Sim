#  1998Hw02: a {+252}Cf source was sandwiched between two Ni foils and    
#  placed at the center of gammasphere with 72 Compton-suppressed Ge      
#  detectors                                                              
#  The identification of {+109}Ru is based on the known |g of the fission 
#  partners                                                               
#  1995Bu14: they have used two different coin experiment, detector array 
#  gammasphere and a small setup with three Ge and two leps, triple       
#  coin analysis                                                          
#  1973Ho22: they proposed a decay scheme for {+109}Ru based on |g|g      
#  measurements of radiations produced in {+252}Cf(SF). The transitions   
#  were assigned to {+109}Ru mainly on the basis of previous work         
#  (1972Ho08,1970WiZN) where the x rays and fission fragments were        
#  measured in coincidence with the gammas. 1995Bu14 have shown that the  
#  98, 74, 172, and 374 gammas were not correctly connected with the      
#  ground state by 1973Ho22.
