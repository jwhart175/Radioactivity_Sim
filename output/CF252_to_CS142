#  2010Li14: Gammasphere detector array. Measured E|g, |g|g, |g|g(|q).    
#  2009Rz02: Includes {+252}Cf SF decay, {+248}Cm SF decay and            
#  {+235}U(n,F). The data from SF fission of {+248}Cm and {+252}Cf        
#  obtained with the Eurogam-2 and Gammasphere detector arrays,           
#  respectively. LEPSs were used to measure low-energy |g's. Measured     
#  E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|g(|q), half-lives by delayed timing method.         
#  Presence of nanosecond isomer was confirmed with  measurements of      
#  delayed |g rays following induced fission of {+235}U carried with      
#  the LOHENGRIN mass spectrometer.                                       
#  Other: 1998Hw04.                                                       
#  218-408-548-702 and 618-387-503 cascades previously assigned to        
#  {+139}Cs (1998Hw04) are reconfirmed as belonging to {+142}Cs           
#  (2010Li14,2009Rz02).                                                   
#  Level scheme is that of 2010Li14; E(level) and E|g are taken from      
#  authors' level scheme, except |g's - 25.3-, 26.4- and 9195-keV         
#  which are seen only in 2009Rz02.                                       
#  J|p are based on |g|g(|q) measurements and band assignments.
