#G RI(D)$From coincidence analysis, assumed to be approximate by the      
#G evaluator.                                                             
#G TI(C)$Inferred from coincidence intensities, 50% uncertainty assumed   
#G by the evaluator for calculation of MR.                                
#G RI$15% uncertainty estimated by authors, except where noted.           
#G M$From CE intensities normalized to the 102.2G assuming E2. The        
#G 102.2G is determined as E2 from the L1:L2:L3 subshell ratios.          
#G The indicated CE intensities are normalized to the same relative scale 
#G as the gammas. The authors suggest that approximately 15%              
#G uncertainty should be assigned to the CE intensities. The evaluator    
#G has doubled this uncertainty for transitions with E>500 KEV when       
#G calculating mixing ratios.                                             
#G M(F)$K conversion coefficient for doublet requires both components to  
#G have indicated admixture.                                              
#G M(G)$Possible E1 assignment ruled out by level parities.               
#G M(H)$Conversion coefficient too large for M1,E1, or E2. Possible E0    
#G admixture.                                                             
#E TI$Calculated from decay scheme intensity balances. About 20% of the   
#E transition intensity is unplaced, suggesting that the weaker feedings  
#E are unreliable.
