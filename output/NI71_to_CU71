#  {+71}Ni beam produced through {+238}U(p,X) reaction with a proton beam 
#  energy of 30 MeV at the LISOL facility. The |g rays were detected      
#  using three high-purity germanium detectors. The |b particles were     
#  detected with four plastic |DE detectors. Measurements were made       
#  with and without laser radiation to disentangle |g rays emitted        
#  by the nuclei of interest from the non-resonant |g rays. Measured      
#  E|g, E|b, |b|g coin, isomer half-life.                                 
#  Details of precise E|g and I|g data are not available according to     
#  an email reply of May 5, 2009 from the first author of 2009St07        
#  The decay scheme is not considered as complete by the evaluators since 
#  there remains a large gap of 7 MEV between the Q- value and the        
#  highest populated level. Both |b branches and associated LOGFT values  
#  are considered as limits.
