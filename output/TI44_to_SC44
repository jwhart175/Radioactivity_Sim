#  Evaluated by E. Browne (LBNL), October 1998. Some revisions were done  
#  by the present evaluators                                              
#  This decay-data evaluation was done under the collaboration which

#  This evaluation was reviewed and                                       
#  accepted by evaluators in the collaboration described above.           
#  The evaluator applied the Limitation of Relative Statistical Weights   
#  (LWM) method (1988WoZO) for averaging numbers throughout this          
#  evaluation. To avoid overestimating precision because of possible data 
#  correlation, the uncertainty assigned to the average was always equal  
#  or greater than the smallest uncertainty of the values used to         
#  calculate the average.
