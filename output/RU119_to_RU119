#  Isomer produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,F),E=345 MeV/nucleon reaction        
#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility. Fission fragments were separated
#  and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal plane of       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper.  
#  Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method.            
#  Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were detected by three     
#  clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer       
#  half-life. Deduced levels
