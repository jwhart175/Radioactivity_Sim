#  223RN activity was produced by spallation of 600-MEV protons on        
#  targets of 232TH and mass separated in the ISOLDE on-line separator.   
#  Characteristic FR XK, and G rays previously observed in the ALPHA      
#  decay of 227AC confirmed the assignment of the activity to 223RN.      
#L           The structure of 223FR has been interpreted in terms of      
#L the reflection-asymmetric rotor model, and most of the levels below    
#L 600 KEV have been assigned to KPI=3/2+- and KPI=1/2+- parity           
#L doublet bands.
