#  1975Br03: GELI; measured EG, IG (69 lines), EB, IB, GG coin, BG coin.

#  EKC (relative to 85KR(304G) and 85RB(151G)).                           
#  The adopted decay scheme is essentially that of 1977Bi01. For          
#  E(level)<4100, it is supported by GG-coin information. The             
#  schemes proposed by 1977Bi01 and 1975Br03 are in excellent agreement;  
#  however, of the 19 levels proposed in 1974Ac04, only 7 are common      
#  to the scheme of 1977Bi01. Total unplaced IG is AP 0.40% in 1977Bi01.  
#  For the decay scheme of 1977Bi01, negative B- feeding of 2460, 2774,   
#  2886 levels is implied by IG imbalance. Also, the distribution of      
#  B- strength implied by their decay scheme differs from that indicated  
#  by the ^TAGS data of 1997Gr09, in that their scheme significantly      
#  overestimates B- strength to E(level)=0.2-2.2 MEV, underestimates it   
#  to E(level)=2.9-3.6 MEV, 4.1-4.4 MEV and AP 5.2 MEV, and grossly       
#  overestimates it to E(level) GE 5.4 MEV.                               
#  From their total G absorption measurements, 1988Al42 drew conclusions  
#  which were qualitatively similar to those of 1997Gr09 concerning the   
#  B- strength distribution.                                              
#  Consequently, the evaluator has modified the scheme from 1977Bi01, as  
#  follows: (i) the placement is indicated as tentative for all gammas    
#  (except the 4645G) deexciting levels which have E>5500 (presumably,    
#  all of these are misplaced since each individual IG exceeds the total  
#  B- branching to the relevant level and no gammas are placed so they    
#  feed these levels); (ii) gammas deexciting these levels in             
#  1977Bi01 have been relocated by the evaluator whenever possible (based 
#  on EG alone) - this affects 981.1G, 1359.9G, 1533.8G, 1753.6G, 1983.2G,
#  3585.4G, 4004.5G; (iii) when calculating intensity balance, all IG     
#  (except I(4645G)) originating from E(level)>5500 have been ignored     
#  (total IG=4.9%); (iv) a new level (or group of levels) has been        
#  introduced at AP 4250 KEV and at AP 5200 KEV, although no unique       
#  assignment of gammas to the level(s) can be suggested at this time;    
#  (v) the previously unplaced 405G has been placed from the 3603 level,  
#  and the 1992G (from the 5396 level in 1977Bi01) has been relocated     
#  deexciting the 4038 level (based on EG and intensity balance at the    
#  5396 level); (vi) placement of the 4271G from the 5414 level is shown  
#  as tentative, based on intensity balance at the 5414 level cf. IB from 
#  ^TAGS.                                                                 
#  These changes result in a scheme which does not imply negative B-      
#  feeding to any level and which marginally improves agreement between   
#  B- feeding deduced from intensity balance and from the                 
#  ^TAGS data of 1997Gr09; however, the major discrepancies in B-         
#  strength distribution persist. It appears to be necessary to introduce 
#  a number of additional levels between 2900 and 3600 KEV; transitions   
#  between these levels and ones below 2200 KEV may conceivably eliminate 
#  much of the feeding to E(level)<2200 implied by the present decay      
#  scheme. However, the observation of BG coin at the 433, 1143 and       
#  1385 levels (1978St02) appears to establish that significant B- feeding
#  to those levels does indeed occur.

#B Where the latter values significantly exceed                           
#B those based on intensity balance, they possibly indicate the existence

#B IB(GS, 93Y)=0 and %B-N(93RB)=1.7. Compared with the adopted decay      
#B schemes, the ratio from 1974Ac04 is a factor of 1.34 low;              
#B consequently, |S(IB to excited states of 93SR)=39% 3
