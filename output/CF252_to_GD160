#  1997Do20: 160SM PRODUCED AS A PRODUCT OF THE 252CF SF DECAY. EXCITED   
#   LEVELS STUDIED VIA THE DEEXCITATION OF THE HIGHLY EXCITED NUCLEUS,    
#   AS FORMED IN THE FISSION PROCESS. DEEXCITING |g's MEASURED USING 72   
#   LARGE-VOLUME Compton-SUPPRESSED Ge DETECTORS AND TWO x-ray DETECTORS  
#   IN THE Gammasphere ARRAY. X|g COINCIDENCES ALSO MEASURED USING TWO    
#   HIGH-RESOLUTION x-ray AND TWO LARGE-VOLUME Compton-suppressed Ge      
#   DETECTORS IN A CLOSE GEOMETRY. MEASURED EG, X|g|g, GG AND XX          
#   COINCIDENCES. REPORT YRAST (GS BAND) LEVELS UP TO THE 8+ LEVEL, WITH  
#   THE 10+ LEVEL SHOWN AS QUESTIONABLE.                                  
#  THIS INFORMATION ALSO APPEARS IN 1997Ha64, ALBEIT WITH A SLIGHTLY      
#   DIFFERENT ENERGY FOR THE (10+) LEVEL.                                 
#  NO RI VALUES ARE REPORTED FOR THE |g's.                                
#L E         COMPUTED FROM THE LISTED EG VALUES.                          
#L J         Values assigned by 1997Do20, based on considerations of      
#L rotational-band structure and the deexcitation characteristics of      
#L the highly excited, high-spin, states produced in the                  
#L spontaneous-fission process. These are the same as the Adopted Values  
#L  (see the comment on the 10+ level).
