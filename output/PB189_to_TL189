#  {+189}Pb source was formed in U(p,X) reaction (UC{-x} target) with a   
#  beam energy of 1.4 GeV. {+189}Pb was also excited using a laser beam   
#  at resonant frequencies from RILIS at the ISOLDE facility at CERN.     
#  Two experiments were performed:                                        
#  1. Measured |b|g coin using 4|p |b plastic scintillator and three Ge   
#  detectors (one planar HPGe and two Ge detectors). The |g rays in       
#  in {+189}Pb were also identified in hyperfine laser spectroscopy       
#  from low-lying levels.                                                 
#  2. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g coin using two HPGe detectors with Be       
#  window. The hyperfine laser spectroscopy was also carried out          
#  for some of the strong |g rays                                         
#  Comparison with rotor plus particle model calculations.                
#  2009Sa09 state (reference 35 in the paper) that measurements of        
#  isotope shift, magnetic moment and |a decay of {+189}Pb to {+185}Hg    
#  will be presented elsewhere.                                           
#  Decay of the high-spin isomer                                          
#E $ The beta feedings and associated log {Ift} values have been deduced  
#E by the evaluators. The feedings given by 2009Sa09 are given under      
#E comments                                                               
#E $ Since this decay has a Q value of over { 5 MeV} and the only         
#E observed levels are below 2.5 MeV, the scheme is                       
#E incomplete.  Therefore, the |e intensities are upper limits and        
#E log{Ift} values are lower limits.                                      
#G $ All the unplaced |g rays are arbitrarily assigned to the decay of the
#G high-spin isomer.                                                      
#G E$ General uncertainty is quoted by 2009Sa09 as 0.2 keV for I|g>3      
#G and 0.4 keV for weaker lines. Uncertainty of 1 keV is assigned         
#G by the evaluators when E|g quoted to nearest keV.                      
#G RI$ General uncertainty is quoted by 2009Sa09 as 15%                   
#G E(A)$ The |g ray mixed with a line from daughter activity              
#G RI(B)$ From hyperfine spectrum in laser spectroscopy. Doublet, one     
#G component from the decay of the high-spin isomer and the other from    
#G the decay of the low-spin isomer of {+189}Pb

#L calculations for oblate and prolate deformations                       
#L E$ From least-squares fit to E|g data using 281-keV level as fixed.    
#L Uncertainty of 7 keV in this energy is not reflected in the
