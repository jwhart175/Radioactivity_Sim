#  These activities have been studied in equilibrium following the decay  
#       of 2.4-h {+158}Er which has been produced by spallation of Ta     
#       with 660-MeV protons with chemical separation or chemical and     
#       mass separation (1968Ab14,1974Al30) and by {+150}Sm({+12}C,4n)    
#       and {+151}Eu({+11}B,4n) reactions (1975Ru02,1978An11). The Ho     
#       activities have also been produced by Ta(p,x) (1974Al30) and      
#       {+148}Nd({+14}N,4n) (1975Ru02) reactions. Others: 1974AlZG,       
#       1973Ch28, 1966La11, 1966Ab02, 1965St08, 1962Sc10, 1961Gr25,       
#       1961Bo24, 1961Ba32, 1961Ab04, 1960Dn01, 1960Ba66, 1960Ab07.       
#L           1978An11 have suggested the assignment of a number of        
#L      excited states as members of octupole bands having KPI=0-, 1-     
#L      and 2-. The evaluator, however, has not adopted these band        
#L      assignments.                                                      
#E           If one assumes that all |e decays are allowed or             
#E      nonunique first forbidden, the 5+ parent will populated levels    
#E      with J = 3, 4, and 5 and the 2- parent will populate levels with  
#E      J = 1, 2, and 3.  Although this would allow some separation of    
#E      the decays of the two parents, a complete separation is not       
#E      possible.  Therefore, no I(-|e+|b+) or log {Ift} values are       
#E      given.                                                            
#G           The longest list of |g's is from 1978An11, but substantial   
#G      lists are also given by 1968Ab14, 1974Al30, and 1975Ru02. There   
#G      are many |g's that are only reported by one or two authors. Any   
#G      |g's reported by only one author are flagged.                     
#G           The coincidence data are from 1978An11.                      
#L E         From least-squares fit to the |g energies.

#L      Adopted Levels for all values.                                    
#G E         Weighted average of values from 1974Al30, 1975Ru02, and      
#G      1978An11 with the larger of the internal and external             
#G      uncertainties used. This process may underestimate the            
#G      uncertainties since 1975Ru02 and 1978An11 have a common author    
#G      so these values may not be independent; this possibility is       
#G      supported by the fact that a number of the energies are exactly   
#G      the same in these two references.  Other: 1968Ab14.               
#G RI        From 1978An11, unless noted otherwise. Other values that     
#G      differ significantly are noted.

#G      and ce data of 1974Al30 and normalized to |a{-K}(218.20)=0.125

#G M(M)      |a{-K}(exp), including the uncertainty, exceeds the M1

#       (adopted value is 1547) fed by a 977 |g from 2528 level and

#  The energy of the parent level, with J|p=(9+) and a configuration of   
#       (|p,7/2[523])+(|n,11/2[505]), has not been measured, but          
#       it has been calculated by 1986So02 to be |? 180 keV and this      
#       value is used for log {Ift} calculations.                         
#            The high spin of the parent suggests that the decay be to    
#       a few levels. such as those at 2528 and 3237 keV.  However, the   
#       low log {Ift} value for the decay to the 2528 level suggests
