#  |g|g-coin in double-gated spectra with |g rays from complementary      
#  fission fragments. Gamma rays were detected by Gammasphere array at

#G E,RI$ Based on a general statement in 2014Lu07 that energy and         
#G intensity uncertainties are 0.1-0.3 keV and 3-10%, respectively,       
#G evaluator assigns as follows: 0.1 keV and 3% for I|g>20, 0.2 keV and   
#G 5% for I|g=10-20, and 0.3 keV and 10% for I|g<10
