#  2001Nu01 (also 2002Nu02): mass-separated {+34}Al produced in U(p,X)    
#  E=1 GeV reaction using uranium carbide target, CERN-ISOLDE facility.   
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |b, |b|g, |b|g|g, |bn|g coin, |b|g(t), T{-1/2} and  
#  delayed neutron-emission probability using Ge and BaF{-2} detectors for
#  |g rays, plastic scintillation detectors for |b rays and neutrons.     
#  No evidence was found for delayed two-neutron decay mode. Comparison   
#  with {Isd-fp} shell-model calculations and Gamow-Teller strengths.     
#  1989Ba50: previous experiment at CERN-ISOLDE facility,                 
#  measured E|g, I|g, %|b{+-}n, estimate of level half-life               
#  from |b|g(t). Evaluators consider it superseded by 2001Nu01, an        
#  improved experiment from the same laboratory                           
#  Energy balance: total decay energy of 12130 keV {I890} deduced         
#  (using RADLIST code) from proposed decay scheme is much lower than     
#  the expected value of 16910 keV {I62}, indicating that the decay scheme
#  is incomplete
