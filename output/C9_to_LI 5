#  1988MI03: Implanted 9C into a thick SI detector and measured the total 
#  |b-delayed breakup energy; deduced |b-decay feeding to low-lying       
#  states. They missed several higherlying states that are fed and did not
#  directly distinguish delayed p vs. |a emission.                        
#  2000GE09: 9C from the ^TRIUMF/^TISOL facility was implanted in a thin  
#  carbon foil. Data were taken in two detector configurations; one       
#  configuration was sensitive to decay through the p+8BE{-g.s.} decay    
#  mode while the other configuration was sensitive to the |a+5LI{-g.s.}  
#  and p+8BE^*(3.0) decay channels. Breakup particles from 9C -> 8BE+p -> 
#  2|a+p and 9C -> 5LI+|a -> 2|a+p were detected either in an array of    
#  4 DE-E telescopes configured with two segmented SI annular detectors   
#  or with a similar array 2 DE-E telescopes configured with two          
#  doublesided position sensitive SI strip detectors and a plastic        
#  scintillator to count |b-particles. Detector sensitivities and         
#  coincidence efficiencies were evaluated by Monte Carlo techniques,     
#  and a phenomenological approach was used to deduce the |b-decay        
#  reaction branching ratios.                                             
#  2001BE51: At the ^CERN/^ISOLDE facility, doublesided strip detectors   
#  (^DSSD) were coupled with thick stopping detectors to provide          
#  high-granularity and large solid angle coverage for detecting decay    
#  particles. Emphasis was placed on characterizing population and decay  
#  of the AP 14.65 MEV IAS. Furthermore a thin DE ^DSSD was implemented   
#  to avoid threshold (efficiency) concerns that troubled (2000GE09).     
#  Lastly, the experimenters evaluated the decay branching ratios for the 
#  12B^*(12.2) state. Little comment is given on other populated levels.  
#  2001BU05: The authors of (2000GE09) give a more rigorous alternate     
#  interpretation of their data in a full R-MATRIX analysis. There is a   
#  poor agreement between deduced level energies and accepted energy      
#  values.                                                                
#                                                                         
#  Comments:                                                              
#  Four relevant articles are given that discuss three different          
#  experimental efforts. Agreement is relatively mixed.                   
#  The experiments that are most sensitive to decay to 9B{-g.s.} find the 
#  largest feeding to that state, we take (54.1 15)% from (2001BE51). Data
#  from ^TRIUMF produced the most comprehensive set of populated          
#  levels, though they are analyzed via two different methods in          
#  (2000GE09) and (2001BU05) yielding somewhat different results, due in  
#  part to differences in the 9B{-g.s.} branch and subsequent             
#  renormalization. Lastly are the states above 14 MEV, (2000GE09) reports
#  only 9B^*(14.0: JPI= ?) which decays mainly via proton emission, while 
#  (2001BE51) reports population of 9B^*(14.6: JPI=3/2-) which decays     
#  about evenly via p and |a emission. On the other hand the analysis of  
#  (2001BU05) reports population of both levels. Finally, in (2000GE09,   
#  2001BU05) a previously unknown 9B level at E{-x}=13.3 MEV is reported. 
#  The 9B ground state feeding from (2001BE51) is accepted here; the      
#  branching ratios from (2000GE09) including the mostly |a background    
#  component are then renormalized ( * 0.864). The branches feeding both  
#  of the E{-x}=14.0 and 14.6 MEV states are accepted, though it may      
#  be that only one level was populated. The particle breakup branching   
#  ratios for 9B^*(12.2) are accepted from (2001BE51). And lastly, the    
#  weak branch to 9B^*(13.3) is included with some uncertainty.
