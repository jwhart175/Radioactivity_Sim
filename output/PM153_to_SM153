#B           For the levels above 80 keV with depopulating |g's, the      
#B      I|b- are from |g-ray intensity balances, but if the TAGS          
#B      results differ significantly, they are noted in a comment.        
#B      Below 80 keV, from total absorption |g (TAGS) measurement         
#B      (1995Gr19, 1997Gr09),  I{-|b-}(0+7+35+53+65)=40% {I6} and then    
#B      from |g intensity balances I{-|b-}(0+7)=10% {I5}.  And,           
#B      I{-|b-}(7) is chosen to be approximately equal to I{-|b-}(0).     
#G           There are a number of other |g rays reported in              
#G      {+152}Sm(n,|g) from the levels reported here, but which have      
#G      not been observed in the {+153}Pm |b- decay. These |g's are       
#G      generally weak and have not been included here.                   
#G           |g|g coincidences are from 1983MaYP.                         
#G E         From 1988WiZY who made use of the precise energies from      
#G      {+152}Sm(n,|g) (1969Sm04).                                        
#G RI        From unweighted average of values of 1978PiZQ, 1983MaYP,     
#G      and 1988WiZY with typical uncertainties assigned. Below 50 keV,   
#G      the intensity balance at the 35-keV level and the I{-|b-}         
#G      data of 1995Gr19 and 1997Gr09 were used to determine that the     
#G      values of 1983MaYP were preferred.                                
#G M,MR      From {+153}Sm Adopted Gammas and comments here.              
#L           From total absorption |g (TAGS) spectra, the |b- decay       
#L      intensity as a function of the excitation energy has been         
#L      deduced (1997Gr09) independent of the |g-ray intensity balances.  
#L      These data imply |b- decay to additional levels, especially       
#L      above the highest level with |g decay at 630 keV.                 
#L E         From least-squares fit to |g energies.
