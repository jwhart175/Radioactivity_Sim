#  1980Ze04:  {+87}Se produced by thermal neutron fission of {+235}U,     
#      chemical separation of fission products, measured |g spectra with  
#      GeLi detectors and measured coincidences                           
#  1975Hu02:   {+87}Se [from {+235}U(n,F) E=thermal] chemically separated 
#      from fission products; measured |g, |g(t), assigned gamma rays at  
#      468.0 and 1497.9 keV based on decay curve T{-1/2} of 6 seconds     
#            See 2014Al15 for TAGs data and implication for decay heat.   
#L E         From least-squares fit to |g energies.                       
#L J         From logft values and |g's to daughter levels.  However      
#L     as the level scheme is very incomplete, assignments are done       
#L     with some risk.
