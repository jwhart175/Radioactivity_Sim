#  2005Sy01:                                                              
#  {+147}Cs produced via thermal neutron-induced fission of {+235}U       
#  target integrated in an ion source. Fission product mass separator     
#  OSIRIS. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g-x coin, |b|g(t) coin, lifetimes    
#  with a three-detector system that included a low-energy photon and     
#  X-ray (LOAX) detector and two HPGe detectors. |b|g(t) coin             
#  measurements involved two fast-response scintillators, a thin NE111A   
#  plastic for |b particle detection, and a small BaF{-2} crystal as well 
#  as a HPGe detector for |g rays.                                        
#  Others: 1981ScZM, 1981ShZH, 1987ScZG                                   
#  The level scheme is from 2005Sy01 and is incomplete. 2005Sy01 compare  
#  their results to 1981ScZM and find discrepancies (see comments below)  
#L E$From least-squares fit to E|g's by evaluator                         
#L J$From Adopted Levels                                                  
#L T$From 2005Sy01, except where noted. Lifetime measurements from        
#L 2005Sy01 were made using Advanced Time-Delayed                         
#L (ATD) |b|g|g(t) method. The values were obtained in least-square       
#L fitting procedure of the whole spectrum to a response function which   
#L was constructed by a convolution of the Gaussian prompt and an         
#L exponential decay curve.                                               
#L E(A)$Observed in 1981ScZM but not in 2005Sy01                          
#G E$From 2005Sy01, except where noted                                    
#G E(a)$Observed in 1981ScZM but not in 2005Sy01                          
#G M(b)$From 1981ScZM and 1987ScZG based on K/L ratios                    
#G RI$Relative intensities                                                
#G RI(X)$From |g-ray singles spectra (2005Sy01)

#G RI(Z)$Average value of |g intensities from |g-ray singles and |g|g     
#G data.
