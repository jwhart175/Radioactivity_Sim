#  1986Cu01: A beam of {+14}Be ions was produced by fragmenting a         
#  540 MeV {+18}O beam on Be and Ta targets. The secondary fragments      
#  were filtered using the RPMS Wein Filter at NSCL and were focused      
#  on a |DE-E stopping detector telescope. When a particle was            
#  measured in the telescope the rf was scrambled until a decay           
#  was measured in the telescope. Analysis of the implantation to         
#  decay period, gated on nuclear species, provided the lifetime          
#  measurement. T{-1/2}=4.2 ms {I7} was measured.                         
#  1988Du09: {+14}Be was produced by fragmentation of a 60 MeV/n {+22}Ne  
#  beam impinging on either a tantalum or a carbon target and was selected
#  using the LISE spectrometer. The |b-particles were                     
#  detected by a plastic scintillator while the delayed neutrons          
#  were detected through the Gd(n,|g) reaction. T{-1/2}=4.35 ms           
#  {I17}, P{-0n}=0.14 {I3}, P{-1n}=0.81 {I4} and P{-2n}=0.05 {I2} were    
#  measured.                                                              
#  1995Be25: {+14}Be ions were produced by fragmenting an 80 MeV/A        
#  {+18}O beam on a Be target and filtering in the A1200 separator. The   
#  beam was implanted in a thick BC412 scintillator during a 10.3 ms      
#  accumulation period, followed by either a 10.3 ms or 40 ms beam-off    
#  counting period. Beta particles from the decay were detected by        
#  the implantation detector, while delayed neutrons were detected        
#  using an array of 15 curved scintillator bars that were placed 1 meter 
#  from the implantation detector. Neutron energies were deduced from the 
#  time-of-flight (tof) between the |b-detector and the neutron array.    
#  In addition a HPGe detector was placed 83 mm from the implantation     
#  target.                                                                
#  Analysis of the data indicated 3-4% contamination from {+11}Li, a      
#  correction was possible since the {+11}Li decay had been studied in    
#  the same configuration. A neutron detector threshold of                
#  0.77 MeV was unfortunately used in the measurements, which led to a    
#  significantly low number of |b-n events. The data showed evdence for   
#  delayed neutron groups at E{-n}= 3.02 MeV {I3} and 3.52 MeV {I7} with  
#  intensities of 0.11% {I2}(stat) {I4}(sys) and 0.30% {I3}(stat)         
#  {I5}(sys); the peaks from these weak branches lay ontop of a broad     
#  peak that is likely associated with 2n and 3n decay. The multi-neutron 
#  branching ratio associated with the broad peak is 5% {I1}(stat)        
#  {I2}(sys). Furthermore, it is plausible that, for example, the         
#  E{-n}=3.52 MeV neutron group may correspond to sequantial 2n decay.    
#  Data from the HPGe detector indicated small participation from two     
#  known transitions in {+13}B with E{-|g}=3528 keV {I1} and 3680 keV     
#  {I1}, however low statistics prevented analysis of the neutron groups  
#  that feed these transitions. No 740 keV |g-ray was observed for        
#  the transition between the first excited state and ground state.       
#  A critical issue in the data collection is the relatively low rate of  
#  delayed neutron emission. While more than 85% of the decays were       
#  expected to be accompanied with neutrons, only about 7% of that        
#  intensity is presently observed. It is then suggested that a state     
#  in {+14}B, neutron unbound by < 800 keV, is strongly populated.        
#  Lifetimes were deduced by two techniques, though high backgrounds      
#  significantly complicated the determinations; 4.8 ms {I2}(stat)        
#  {I4}(sys) was deduced from the raw decay curve while 4.0 ms {I12} was  
#  deduced from the |b-n coincidence data.                                
#  1997Be66: The authors of (1995Be25) carried out a new measurement      
#  at RIKEN, aimed at identifying the low-energy neutron group that       
#  participates in the decay. A {+14}Be beam was produced by fragmenting  
#  a 100 MeV/A {+18}O beam on a Be target; the beam was implanted in the  
#  center of a Si detector telescope comprised of 5 detectors. The        
#  telescope was sandwiched between two sets of plastic scintillators     
#  that detected beta particles. Neutrons were detected in an array of    
#  BC408 scintillator walls that were positioned |? 200 cm from the       
#  implantation detector. In addition a HPGe detector was positioned      
#  131 mm from the implantation detector.                                 
#  Analysis of the decay curve indicates T{-1/2}=4.29 ms {I18}. Attention 
#  was focused on the neutron energy region below E{-n}=800 keV, where    
#  a sharp peak with E{-n}=287 keV {I3} and width=60 keV {I5} is observed.
#  The peak falls at the edge of the neutron detectors' thresholds        
#  and hence yields significant uncertainty in the branching ratio;       
#  I(n:287)=39 to 100%. No |g-rays are observed in coincidence with       
#  the neutron group, strongly (but inconclusively) suggesting decay      
#  to {+13}B ground state. Decay to {+13}B{-g.s.} would imply decay from  
#  a {+14}B*(1.28 MeV {I2}). The 740 keV |g-ray is not found in the       
#  spectrum, and no comment is given on the 3528 and 3680 keV gamma       
#  rays.                                                                  
#  1999Be53, 2002Be53: An uranium carbide target was bombarded by a 1-GeV 
#  proton beam to produce a {+14}Be beam that was implanted in a kapton   
#  foil located at the center of a moderated {+3}He cylindrical           
#  neutron counter array.                                                 
#  The |b-particles from {+14}Be decay were detected by a plastic         
#  scintillator located directly behind the implantation foil. The        
#  P{-n} value was determined from the rate of neutrons detected in the   
#  {+3}He counter. The total neutron-emission probability P{-n}=101%      
#  {I4} was measured along with an upper limit of P{-2n}+3P{-3n}          
#  < 2.4% (95% confidence limit). Combining P{-n} with the P{-2n}+3P{-3n} 
#  limit P{-1n} |? 100%(> 96%), P{-0n} < 4%, and P{-2n}+3P{-3n}=0.8% {I8} 
#  were deduced.                                                          
#  1997Ao01, 1997Ao04, 2002Ao03: A thick Be target was bombarded by a     
#  100 MeV/A {+18}O beam to produce a {+14}Be beam that was selected by   
#  the RIPS separator. The beam was implanted in a Si detector.           
#  The |b-rays were detected using a set of |DE-|DE-E plastic             
#  scintillator detectors that were positioned above and below the        
#  implantation detector, and a |DE-|DE coincidence requirement           
#  was implemented to reduce background. Neutrons were detected either    
#  in a low-energy array located 50 cm away from the stopper or           
#  in a high-energy array located 1.5 m from the stopper. In addition a   
#  HPGe clover detector was placed 149 mm from the target.                
#  T{-1/2}=4.84 ms {I10} was deduced by analyzing the                     
#  the decay curve associated with the E{-n}=288-keV group; there is no   
#  understanding of the discrepancy between this and prior values.        
#  The neutron tof spectrum was dominated by E{-n}=288 keV {I1} peak,     
#  I(n:288)=91% {I9}, that was not found in coincidence with any |g-ray.  
#  The intensity of an additional neutron group at E{-n}=3.51 MeV {I6}    
#  is found to be in agreement with the expectation from |b-delayed       
#  neutron decay of the {+13}B daughter nucleus. The present analysis     
#  was insensitive to the 3.02 MeV group reported by 1995Be25.            
#  The |g-ray spectrum indicated peaks at E{-|g}=3536 keV {I2} and 3685   
#  keV {I1}; the 3536 keV transition with I(|g)=0.9% {I3} is ascribed to  
#  a transition fed following delayed neutron decay to states in {+13}B,  
#  while the 3685 keV transition is fed in {+13}B decay to {+13}C states. 
#  Analysis of the data provides a measure on the 0n, 1n and 2n decay     
#  branches. While the 740 keV transition between {+14}B first excited    
#  state and {+14}B{-g.s.} is not observed, a limit on decay to either of 
#  these states is found as I(0n) < 0.6% by searching for the 6.09 MeV    
#  |g-ray that is fed in 81% of {+14}B decays to {+14}C. Similarly, the   
#  intensity of the 3685 keV transition, which is fed by 7.6% of {+13}B   
#  decays to {+13}C, implies I(1n)=94% {I5}. While no details on 2n decay 
#  are observed, I(2n)=6% {I5} is deduced.                                
#  Comments:                                                              
#  With the exception of (1988Du09), all experiments find only upper      
#  limits on the population of the bound levels in {+14}B*(0,740);        
#  stringent limits of P(0n) < 4% (1999Be53) and < 0.6% (1997Ao04)        
#  are determined. P(0n) < 0.6%, which is based on the search for         
#  {+14}B decay radiations is accepted.                                   
#  Evidence for |b-delayed one neutron decay is significant. Analysis     
#  of the {+13}B radiations implies I(1n)=94% {I5} (1997Ao04) while       
#  data from a moderated {+3}He counter gives                             
#  I(1n) > 96% (1999Be53).                                                
#  The decay path is not fully understood for all the intensity.          
#  (1997Ao04) assign 91% {I9} of the intensity to decay from              
#  {+14}B*(1.28 MeV {I1}) to {+13}B{-g.s.}; no |g-rays are observed in    
#  coincidence, so the |b-decay is here assumed to populate               
#  {+14}B*(1.28 MeV) directly. Two additional decay radiations            
#  appear relevant to |b{+-}1n decay; first is the 3536 keV transition    
#  to {+13}B ground state observed by (1995Be25) and (1997Ao04),          
#  and second is the E{-n}=3.02 MeV group observed by (1995Be25).         
#  The intensity I(|g:3536)=0.9% {I3} was measured by (1997Ao04),         
#  though no neutron group was observed in a coincidence spectrum.        
#  Very weak population of an E{-n}=3.02 MeV group was observed           
#  by (1995Be25); while no |g-rays are observed in a coincidence,         
#  the neutron group cannot be definitively associated with decay to      
#  {+13}B{-g.s.}.                                                         
#  The 2n and 3n decay modes are not clearly identifiable,                
#  most reported values are given as upper limits. Two relevant results   
#  are given in (1997Ao04), where I(2n)=6% {I5} is deduced from           
#  their I(0n) < 0.6% and I(1n)=94% {I6} values, and in                   
#  (1999Be53) where analysis of the n-n and n-n-n                         
#  correlations in their moderated {+3}He counter set the limit           
#  P{-2n}+3P{-3n} < 0.8% {I8} (based on the 95% confidence                
#  limit P{-2n}+3P{-3n} < 0.8% {I8}.                                      
#  Most of the lifetime measurements are consistent with                  
#  values near 4.3 ms: T{-1/2}=4.2 ms {I7} (1986Cu01), 4.35 ms {I17}      
#  (1988Du09), 4.8 ms {I2}(sta) {I4}(sys)                                 
#  and 4.0 ms {I12} (1995Be25), 4.29 ms {I12} (1997Be66) and 4.84 ms {I10}
#  (1997Ao07); however, the most precise value is the most discrepant.    
#  The value  T{-1/2}=4.31 ms {I24} is accepted; this value               
#  is the weighted value of measurements, excluding (1997Ao07),           
#  with the uncertainty doubled.                                          
#  Further studies on the open charged particle decay channels have       
#  found the |b{+-}|a intensity of I(|a) < 0.4% (2002Je14)                
#  and the |b{+-}t intensity of I(t) = 0.02% {I1} (2002Je14); the parent
