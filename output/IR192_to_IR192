#L E(B),J(B)$1959Sc41 conclude that the 241 Y isomer's ^IT either feeds   
#L the GS or is followed by radiation(s) with EG<30 KEV. The tentative    
#L 6+ 12.98-keV and 6- 16.05-keV states (see Adopted Levels) would not    
#L have been detected by 1959Sc41; the former would suggest J|p=11- for   
#L the isomer, analogous to that for the {+190}Ir high-spin isomer. Also, 
#L Nilsson model calculations (1997BaZV) predict low-lying 11- and 10+    
#L states. The latter state and a low-lying 9+ state predicted by         
#L interacting-boson fermion-fermion calculations (1991Ke10), however, do 
#L not appear to be compatible with an E5 isomeric transition.
