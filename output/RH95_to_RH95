#  Measured |g's, |b{++}'s, |g|g-coin, |b|g-coin, |g(t); Ge(Li), scin.    
#  Assignment of |g's to {+95}Rh decay was made based on their            
#  half-lives, excitation function and appropriate reduction in their     
#  intensities relative to those of other Rh isotopes when a natural Ru   
#  target was used                                                        
#  The strong 543|g was interpreted as an isomeric transition by          
#  1975We03  because it is not in coincidence with any |b or |g-ray in    
#  the decay of {+95}Rh to {+95}Ru
