#  The decay scheme is that of 2000PFZZ, a fragment of which              
#  was presented in 1989PFZZ. A very tentative 1994 level, whose          
#  existence was suggested by the BG coin work of 1989GR03, has also      
#  been included.                                                         
#B           1989GR03: deduced Q(|b{+-})=12155 100 based on B             
#B endpoint energies for 14 BG coin spectra (13 branches); revised to     
#B Q(|b{+-})=12220 55 in 1992GRZX cf. 12210 50 from 2003AU03 and          
#B 12537 7 FROM 2011AUZZ.                                                 
#B           Average E(|b) per decay =3860 (1982AL01) cf. 3500 900        
#B CALCULATED FOR THE PRESENT DECAY SCHEME USING THE ^RADLST CODE.        
#B IB        Deduced by evaluator from photon intensity balance at each   
#B level. The values shown  do not include the (unknown) uncertainty in   
#B IG data; the latter could be very significant.                         
#B (see also the comment on decay scheme normalization).                  
#B LOGFT     Values are given as limits; see comment on decay scheme      
#B normalization. Note also that the uncertainty                          
#B in measured photon intensities is unknown.                             
#B E(D)      Measured endpoint energy for B- spectrum in                  
#B coincidence with G ray(s) deexciting this level; data from 1989GR03,   
#B have been rounded to nearest 10 KEV.                                   
#G E         From 2000PFZZ, except as noted. All but 17 of the placed     
#G transitions were also reported in 1989PFZZ (from E(level) LE 1805) or  
#G in 1989GR03 (from E(level)>1805); gammas reported only in 2000PFZZ     
#G are indicated.                                                         
#G RI        Relative photon intensity, from 2000PFZZ; for transitions    
#G deexciting E(level) LE 1805, these data are also given (rounded-off    
#G values) in 1989PFZZ. Authors do not state uncertainty.

#G E(B)      From 1975KR17. G not reported in 1989GR03, 1989PFZZ or       
#G 2000PFZZ; probably does not belong to 92KR.                            
#G E(G)      Reported only in 2000PFZZ.                                   
#L E         From least-squares FIT TO EG allowing an uncertainty         
#L of 1 KEV in all EG data, except as noted.                              
#L J,T       From Adopted Levels.

#L E(E)      Data of 1989GR03 imply that a 593G feeds this level, but no  
#L G ray deexciting this level has been reported. The evaluator,          
#L therefore, denotes level's existence as tentative.
