#  2008Tr07: {+33}Mg produced in the reaction Be({+48}Ca,X) with an       
#  E=140 MeV/nucleon beam provided by the National Superconducting        
#  Cyclotron Lab at MSU. A1900 fragment separator used to isolate         
#  {+33}Mg. Detected charged particles using the double-sided             
#  silicon strip detector of the beta counting system. Measured           
#  E|g, I|g, |g|g using 16 Ge detectors of the Segmented                  
#  Germanium Array.                                                       
#  2006AnZW: {+33}Mg produced by fragmentation of {+36}S beam,            
#  measured E|g, En, |b|g coin, |bn coin. Detector system: EXOGAM         
#  clover (Ge) detectors, a low-energy photon spectrometer (LEPS),        
#  eight low-energy neutron detectors, and delayed neutron detector       
#  array TONNERRE at GANIL facility

#  2002Mo29: Measured {+33}Mg isotope half-life                           
#  1984La03, 1984Gu19: Measured |b-delayed neutrons, {+33}Mg isotope      
#  half-life and |bn coin, %|b{+-}n.                                      
#  {+33}Mg also decays to {+32}Al by delayed neutrons.                    
#  Based on shell-model calculations 2008Tr07 propose 1p-1h and           
#  3p-3h mixed configuration for g.s. of {+33}Mg; and 0p-0h and 2p-2h     
#  mixed configuration for {+33}Al g.s.
