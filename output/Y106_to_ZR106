#  1997Be70: {+106}Y first produced in Pb({+238}U,F), E=750 MeV/nucleon.  
#  Identification by time-of-flight, FRS at GSI facility. No other        
#  properties of this decay were determined in this work.                 
#  2011Ni01: {+106}Y nuclide produced in Be({+238}U,F) reactions at       
#  E=345 MeV/nucleon produced by the cascade operation of the RIBF complex
#  of accelerators at RIKEN. Target=550 mg/cm{+2}. Identification of      
#  {+106}Y made on the basis of magnetic rigidity, time-of-flight and     
#  energy loss. The separated nuclei were implanted in a nine-layer       
#  double-sided silicon-strip detector (DSSSD). Correlations were recorded
#  between the heavy ions and |b rays. The half-life of {+106}Y isotope   
#  was measured from the correlated ion-|b decay curves and maximum       
#  likelihood analysis technique. In the analysis of the decay curve,     
#  |b-detection efficiency, background rate, daughter and granddaughter   
#  (including those populated in delayed neutron decays) half-lives, and  
#  |b-delayed neutron emission probabilities were considered. Comparison  
#  of measured half-lives with FRDM+QRPA and KTUY+GT2 calculations        
#  2011Su11 (also 2013Su08): same experimental arrangement as in 2011Ni01.
#  |b-decay events selected using position and time correlations          
#  between implantation and |b-ray events. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g,       
#  |b|g coin                                                              
#  2015Lo04: {+106}Y nuclide produced at RIBF-RIKEN facility in           
#  {+9}Be({+238}U,F) reaction at E=345 MeV/nucleon with an average        
#  intensity of 6|*10{+10} ions/s. Measured half-life of {+106}Y
