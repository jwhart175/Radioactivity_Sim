#  Isomer produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,F),E=345 MeV/nucleon reaction        
#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility. Fission fragments were separated
#  and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal plane of       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper.  
#  Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method.            
#  Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were detected by three     
#  clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer       
#  half-life. Deduced levels                                              
#  2012LaZT: {+9}Be(({+238}U,F)=750 MeV/nucleon; target=1 g/cm{+2} of     
#  {+9}Be; Detectors: FRS, comprising four dipole magnets,                
#  multiwire chambers, scintillator detectors, ionization chamber at      
#  GSI. RISING multidetector array consisting of 105 HPGe                 
#  detectors arranged in 15 Cluster detectors; Measured: E|g, I|g, |g(t), 
#  isomer half-life; deduced J|p, single-particle configurations. Only    
#  the 184-keV |g reported in this work                                   
#  2007To23, 2006ToZW: isomer in {+117}Ru observed in fragmentation       
#  of 120 MeV/nucleon {+136}Xe beam and using Beta Counting System at     
#  NSCL-MSU facility. Only one |g ray at 184.4 keV {I2} (2006ToZW)        
#  is observed, and its decay curve gives T{-1/2}=1.4 |ms {I6}

#G M(Y)$From 2012Ka36, based on consideration of Weisskopf estimates and  
#G intensity balances. See also 2012LaZT for possible E1 assignment       
#G for 184-keV transition; 2006ToZW propose E2                            
#G E(X)$ Reverse ordering of the 82.5-102.9 |g cascade is also possible
