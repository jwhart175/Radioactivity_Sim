#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the            
#  RIBF accelerator complex at RIKEN facility bombarded a Be target.      
#  Fission fragments were separated and analyzed by BigRIPS separator,    
#  transported to focal plane of ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally      
#  implanted in an aluminum stopper. Particle identification was achieved 
#  by |DE-tof-B|r method. Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were
#  detected by three clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g,       
#  |g|g-coin, isomer half-life. Deduced levels. Comparison with previous  
#  studies.                                                               
#  1999Ge01: {+106}Nb isomer produced and identified in thermal neutron   
#  induced fission in {+241}Pu and also neutron-induced fission in        
#  {+239}Pu for verification of isotopic assignment of the isomer. Six    
#  gamma rays were observed at 63.5, 94.5, 107.3, 147.4, 201.8 and 204.6  
#  keV, the last one being the most intense in the gamma-ray spectrum     
#  Fig. 13 of 1999Ge01. Half-life was measured from the decay curves for  
#  94.5, 107.3, 201.8 and 204.6 gamma lines in the spectrum. A preliminary
#  level scheme without any J|p assignment was proposed, which is given   
#  here, and later confirmed in 2012Ka36 and 2014Lu07. The gamma          
#  intensities were not given in this work                                
#  The decay scheme is from 1999Ge01, none was given by 2012Ka36
