#  1980WI13: 31S from 31P(P,N), 11 MEV protons from the ^ONR-^CIT tandem  
#  accelerator. Target of ^MnP powder was bombarded then transferred to a 
#  counting station via a pneumatic shuttle (rabbit) system. Ge detectors 
#  used to measure E|g and I|g. ALSO 1980WIZQ THESIS                      
#  1974AL03: 31S from 31P(P,N), 10 MEV protons from the ^Van de ^Graaff at
#  ^Brookhaven. Rabbit transfer system from bombarding chamber to remote  
#  counting cell. ^Ge detectors used for E|g and I|g measurements.        
#  1971DE05: 31S from 31P(P,N), 9-18 MEV protons from ^University of      
#  ^Colorado ^Nuclear ^Physics lab. Phosphorus target bombarded then      
#  transferred to a counting station via pneumatic shuttle system.        
#  Ge detectors used for |b-delayed |g-ray measurements but only reported
