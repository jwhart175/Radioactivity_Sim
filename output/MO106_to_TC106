#  1995Jo02: {+106}Mo activity from {+238}U(p,f): EP=20 MeV. Measured:    
#  T(B-), Q-, IG, I(CE), BG, GG, G(X), G(CE), |b{+-}(CE), G(CE)-coin.     
#  Deduced: 106TC levels, LOGFT, J, PI, ICC, I(B-). Ge, plastic detector  
#  Conversion electrons measured with a lens-type conversion-electron     
#  spectrometer. I(|g+ce) obtained using three  different arrangements    
#  with coincidences between conversion electrons, gammas,                
#  betas and X-rays. Efficiency of lens spectrometer calibrated internally
#  with transitions with known conversion coefficients. For more details, 
#  see 1995Jo02. No details given on normalization of conversion electron 
#  and gamma intensity scales                                             
#  1980TiZX: activity from {+239}Pu(th n,f); rapid molybdenum chem        
#  measured: E|g, I|g, |g|g, deduced: {+106}Tc levels                     
#  Others: 1969WiZX, 1976KaYO, 1977Ki14, 1977Ti02                         
#  Unless stated otherwise, all data taken from 1995JO02                  
#  LOGFT: the LOGFT values are calculated under the assumption of no GS B-
#  transition. For  several levels, due to large uncertainties on the     
#  B- branches only limits could be given. These large uncertainties are  
#  partly due to the large uncertainty on ECC (23.5G): 6.4<ECC(23.5G)<73.1
#B $Decay scheme may be incomplete  and IB suspect as only levels up to   
#B 736 keV are observed                                                   
#G M$From ECC and K/L measurements (1995JO02).                            
#G $ECC: from conversion electron measurements, unless mentioned otherwise
#L E$ Obtained by evaluators using a least-squares fit from measured gamma
#L T$From B-G delayed coincidences, for the two excited states.
