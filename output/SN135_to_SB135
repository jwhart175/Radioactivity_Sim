#  2005Sh36: {+135}Sn isotope produced in U(n,F) using UC{-2} target,     
#  neutrons produced by 1.4 GeV protons bombarding a tungsten target. The 
#  Sn isotopes selectively ionized using the Resonance Ionization Laser   
#  Ion Source consisting of three Cu vapor pumped dye lasers. Mass        
#  separation. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g(t). Data collected with        
#  "laser-on" and "laser-off" to distinguish which peaks in |g spectra    
#  belonged to decay of Sn isotopes and which were a result of decay of   
#  surface ionized {+135}Cs. Shell-model calculations                     
#  See also 2005Sh23 for {+135}Sn delayed neutron decay to {+134}Sb       
#  2002Sh08 (also 2001Sh12): Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, lifetimes, delayed  
#  neutron probability using high-efficiency Mainz neutron long counter   
#  with 3-ring concentric array of 50 {+3}He proportional counters, |b    
#  detector and Pb-shielded Ge detectors. A total of 12 |g rays reported. 
#  2001Ko45: Measured E|g and |g|g using two large and one small          
#  low-energy Ge detectors in coincidence with |b rays recorded in a      
#  thin plastic scintillator. Only three |g rays reported at 281.7,       
#  732.4 and 923.4                                                        
#  2007Ko66: {+135}Sn activity produced from fission of {+235}U by thermal
#  neutrons followed by mass spectrometer OSIRIS at Studsvik facility.    
#  Measured lifetime of the 282 level using |b|g|g(t) technique. Fast     
#  response |b, BaF{-2} and Ge detectors were used. Comparison of         
#  M1 and E2 transition probabilities of 282|g with shell-model           
#  calculations

#B IB,LOGFT$Values are considered as approximate for excited states       
#B since a large gap of |?5.5 MeV between Q(|b{+-}) and the highest known 
#B level at 3263 leaves the possibility of additional levels and          
#B unobserved |g decays. The log {Ift} arguments used by 2005Sh36 for     
#B some of the J|p assignments are not considered by the evaluators       
#B as strong arguments.                                                   
#G E$2005Sh36 list E|g to nearest keV. Since the uncertainty is
