#  {+115}Ru produced in 25-MeV proton-induced fission of uranium          
#  followed by mass separation at IGISOL-JYFLTRAP facility. The |g rays   
#  were detected by three Ge detectors, a planar Ge detector (LOAX) and   
#  a plastic scintillator for |b radiation. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g,      
#  |b|g, (x ray)|g coin                                                   
#  Level scheme is from 2011Ri07. Levels up to 696 were also reported in  
#  2007Ku06, and up to 1258 in 2010Ku01                                   
#  All data are from 2011Ri07, unless otherwise stated                    
#B $By comparison the total |b feeding to states in {+115}Rh with that    
#B to |b feeding of states in {+115}Pd in {+115}Ru --> {+115}Rh -->       
#B {+115}Pd decay chain, 2011Ri07 find that 6% {I6} of the |b feeding     
#B from {+115}Ru is unaccounted. One possibility is that the 76-ms        
#B isomer found in 2010Ku25 partly decays by |b decay which may also      
#B explain small |b feeding of (7/2+) state at 617.6                      
#B LOGFT$2011Ri07 state that all log| {Ift} values should be considered   
#B as lower limits since there is possibility of missing high-energy      
#B low-intensity |g rays from high-lying levels allowed by large Q(|b)    
#B window.                                                                
#G $A 61.7-keV |g ray is seen in singles |g spectrum in 2010Ku01, but     
#G not in |b-gated spectrum. Its half-life was measured as 76 ms {I14}.   
#G In a further study, 2010Ku25 assigned this an isomer in {+115}Ru       
#G E,RI$From 2011Ri07. Intensities are from |b-gated singles |g spectrum,
