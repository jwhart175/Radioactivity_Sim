#  2004Sc42, 2003Ge04, 2002Ge07: E(n)=thermal. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g,   
#  |g(t) using two large-volume Ge detectors and two cooled Si(Li)        
#  detectors after isotopic separation by the LOHENGRIN spectrometer.     
#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility. Fission fragments were separated
#  and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal plane of       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper.  
#  Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method.            
#  Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were detected by three     
#  clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer       
#  half-life.

#  2004Ga24: the {+129}In isotope was obtained by thermal-neutron         
#  induced fission of a {+235}U carbide target inside the combined        
#  target and ion source ANUBIS.  During the measurements of singles      
#  data, surface ionization was used to select the element In and         
#  thereby suppress the daughter activities. Measured E|b, E|g, I|g,      
#  |g|g, |b|g(coin), |g|g(t), T (isotope) with 3 Ge detectors of          
#  which one was a LEPS. Three Ge detectors were also                     
#  used for the Q{-|b} measurement, where the LEPS detector was used as a 
#  |b spectrometer.
