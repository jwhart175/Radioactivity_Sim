#  2004Lu20: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, lifetimes with the Gammasphere      
#  array,comprised of 102 active Compton-suppressed Ge detectors.         
#  Levels of {+109}Tc were studied through the spontaneous fission of     
#  a {+252}Cf source sandwiched between two Fe foils, and placed in an    
#  8-cm polyethylene ball.                                                
#  1998Hw04: a {+252}Cf source was sandwiched between two Ni foils and    
#  placed at the center of gammasphere with 72 Compton suppressed Ge      
#  detectors                                                              
#  The identification of {+109}Tc is based on the known |g of the Cs      
#  partners                                                               
#  1997Bh06: They used {+252}Cf and {+248}Cm with EUROGAM II. They show in
#  a figure few |g lines of {+109}Tc. No level scheme is given            
#  Other data from: 1970Wa05, 1971Ho29, 1970Jo20, 1973Ho22, 1972ChYZ      
#  The gammas unplaced below are proposed as transitions in {+109}Tc.     
#  These data were obtained from measurements made of the fission         
#  fragments, conversion electrons, and |g rays from {+252}Cf(SF).        
#  Mass assignments for the gammas were made by 1970Wa05 and 1970Jo20,    
#  while nucleus assignment was made by 1970Wa05 and 1971Ho29. No         
#  placement of the gammas has been provided and they are not observed by 
#  1998Hw04.

#G E$Transition energies listed to two decimal places in 2004Lu20 for
