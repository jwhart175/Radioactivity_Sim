#  1999Mi17: {+73}Kr produced by bombarding a niobium target with a       
#  600-MeV proton beam Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g, delayed protons,    
#  and half-life using a 4|p |b-detector and two Ge counters of 33% and   
#  80% efficiency, and a Si(Li) counter. See also 2000Gi11 for            
#  beta-delayed proton spectra and (proton)(|g) coin.                     
#  Others:                                                                
#  1973Da22: {+73}Kr produced by chemical separation and identified by the
#  growth of {+73}Br product. Measure E|g, I|g of 9 |g-rays, out of which 
#  8 were placed in the level scheme.                                     
#  1974Ro11: {+73}Kr produced by bombarding a zinc target with 600-MeV    
#  proton beam. Measured E|g, I|g, E|b, |b|g coin, T{-1/2} of 16 |g-rays.

#  For studies which measured Q{-|e}-B{-p}, see 1972Ho20, 1976Ha29.       
#  Decay scheme constructed using observed energy sums and intensities    
#  Decay to high-lying proton-emitting levels amounting to 0.68% {I12}
