#  The decay scheme is from 1973Da05. It disagrees in several important   
#  respects with that of 1973Mo18. Neither reported decay scheme is       
#  complete, with significant numbers of B and G transitions              
#  most likely being unobserved. For this reason, no G-intensity          
#  normalization is given, and G-intensity balances cannot be used        
#  to deduce B-transition intensities.
