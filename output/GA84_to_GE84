#  ORNL's Low-energy Radioactive Ion Beam Spectroscopy Station. Measured

#  {+238}U followed by mass separation (ISOL method). Measured E|g,       
#  |g|g, |b|g coin.  In this article, a |g-ray of 820 keV was             
#  tentatively attributed to the 2+ to 0+ transition in 84GE.  The        
#  half-life of this gamma ray was measured to be 65 MS 36,  which is in  
#  agreement with the 85 MS 10 adopted value.  However, in 2006PE20, a    
#  later article by the same authors of 2003PE18,  it is said that "no    
#  new |g-line was found as a candidate to the 2+ to 0+ in 84GE because   
#  of low statistics".  As a result, the earlier 2003PE18 result is not   
#  adopted.  The works of 2008WiZZ, 2009GR06 AND 2009LEZZ put the 2+      
#  energy at 624 keV.
