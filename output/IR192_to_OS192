#G 1985DAZX, 1985EI01, 1984IW03, 1983SC12, 1975PR03, 1973GE05 ARE         
#G TABULATED ABOVE. THE RECOMMENDED VALUES ARE WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF THESE 
#G DATA, EXCLUDING DATA GIVEN AS LIMITS OR IDENTIFIED AS STATISTICAL      
#G OUTLIERS BASED ON THE Chauvenet CRITERION, EXCEPT AS NOTED.  NOTE THAT 
#G MOST DATA FROM 1975PR03 are identified as outliers.                    
#G M         From EKC, except where noted. Conversion coefficient values  
#G attributed to 1966SC20 were calculated by the evaluator from IG given  
#G here and ICE from 1966SC20; the photon and CE intensity                
#G scales were normalized assuming KC(E2 THEORY)=0.0535 for 316.5G(192PT).
#G MR        From G-ray linear polarization (oriented nuclei) (1985RI13), 
#G except where noted. Data of 1985RI13 supersede those of 1985RI07.      
#G E(B)      From 2000HE14, based on a revised energy scale               
#G that uses the new fundamental constants and wave lengths from an       
#G updated value of the Si crystal lattice spacing (1987CO39).            
#G 2000HE14 fitted the revised G-ray energies to a level scheme. Their    
#G recommended G-ray energies are from level-energy differences corrected 
#G for recoil.   SEE 1999HE26 FOR DISCUSSION OF IMPROVEMENT OF 192IR
