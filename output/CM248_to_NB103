#  {+248}Cm chemically purified.                                          
#  The {+248}Cm source was placed at the normal target position           
#  of the Argonne-Notre Dame BGO |g Ray Facility.                         
#  10 BGO-suppressed Ge detectors, 2 LEPS, an array 50 BGO                
#  detectors. 500 million coin events recorded.                           
#  The authors use the fission properties of the fragments (complementary)
#  and the coin with previously established transitions to identify the   
#  nuclides.
