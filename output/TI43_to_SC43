#  1987Ho14: {+43}Ti nuclides were produced by the {+40}Ca(|a,n) reaction 
#  with an 18 MeV alpha beam from the MC-20 cyclotron of the University of
#  Jyvaskyla. |b-rays were detected by a 500 |mm, 300 mm{+2} Si(Au)       
#  surface-barrier detector and |g-rays by a 15.5% Ge detector. Measured  
#  E|g, I|g, E(|b). Deduced levels,  |b- and |g-branchings, T{-1/2}.
