#  2006AnZW: {+33}Mg produced in fragmentation of {+36}S beam at          
#  GANIL facility, measured |g and delayed neutrons from its decay.       
#  {+33}Na also decays to {+31}Mg by |b{+-}2n (13% {I3}) and to           
#  {+32}Mg by |b{+-}n (47% {I6}); total                                   
#  All data are from 2001Nu02, unless otherwise stated                    
#  The data on neutron energies are not available in detail to            
#  deduce all the level energies in {+33}Mg populated by {+33}Na          
#  |b decay. Several |g rays are unplaced and there still could be        
#  unobserved transitions in the large energy gap allowed by              
#  the Q(|b{+-}) value.                                                   
#B IB,LOGFT$ The evaluators consider the level scheme as incomplete       
#B and tentative, thus all |b branches are considered as upper limits     
#B and associated log| {Ift} values as lower limits.

#G E(A)$ The evaluators note that 1857.7-1011.3=846.4, which matches the  
#G gamma energy of 845.7 {I2} keV within the uncertainty range and may    
#G suggest a level at 1011.3+845.7=1856 and another level either at 1011  
#G or 846. The evaluators tentatively define a level at 1856.7 keV. Also  
#G 845.7-297.9=547.8 which is close in energy to 546.2|g
