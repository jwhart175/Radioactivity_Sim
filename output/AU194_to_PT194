#G $ A2 AND A4 COEFFICIENTS ARE FROM GG(THETA) DATA OF 1996TEZW           
#G E,RI$ FROM 1996TEZW, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED. VALUES AVAILABLE         
#G 1974HEYW AND 1970BE30 AGREE WELL WITH THOSE FROM 1996TEZW BUT          
#G ARE GENERALLY LESS PRECISE. ENERGIES FROM 1974HEYW ARE LISTED          
#G IN THE 1996 NDS FOR A=194 (1996BR26). In cases where RI'S HAVE         
#G been deduced from ICE data, the data have been                         
#G normalized to ICE(K)(328G)=100 and KC(328G)=0.0492                     
#G M,MR$ Mainly from CE data, GG(THETA) DATA OF 1996TEZW ARE ALSO USED    
#G WHERE APPLICABLE

#G E(B)$ Transition from photo electron data of 1964Be23 and 1960Ba17

#G E(K)$ G from 1997Te09 and 1996TeZW only, observed in coincidence with  
#G other G rays with ^HERA array of 20 intrinsic germanium detectors.     
#G E(X)$ NOT REPORTED BY 1996TEZW, ITS EXISTENCE TREATED AS UNCERTAIN

#L E$ From least-squares fit to EG's. The least-squares fit procedure     
#L employed here using ^GTOL code at ^Brookhaven gives normalized         
#L |h{+2}=2.1, with about 20 measured |g-ray energies lying outside       
#L of fitted level-energy differences by 2 |s's and another five by       
#L 3 |s's. This suggests that some of the energy uncertainties quoted     
#L by 1996TeZW are underestimated probably by a factor of about 2.        
#L An extreme situation is presented by 69.64|g which deviates by 1 KEV,
