#  1978An25 and 1977ZuZV produced sources by spallation of Ta target      
#       with 660-MeV protons followed by mass separation; measured E|g,   
#       I|g, |g-ce coincidences with Ge detector and magnetic             
#       spectrometer as well as level T{-1/2} by delayed |g-ce            
#       coincidences with magnetic spectrometer and plastic               
#       scintillator. Other measurements: 1974Sc19 with sources from      
#       {+147}Sm({+10}B,4n) and 1981PaZP with sources from Tb({+3}He,xn). 
#E TI        Since the Q|e value is over 4 MeV and levels are reported    
#E      to only 565 keV, this scheme is very incomplete. Therefore, the   
#E      intensity balances can not be expected to give good estimates of  
#E      the |e+|b+ feedings. These balances at the excited states would   
#E      give |e+|b+ feedings of 23, 31, 20, 16, and 13% in order of       
#E      increasing level energy. If one assumes that 50% of the |e+|b+    
#E      feeding is to higher energy levels, the relative feeding to       
#E      these five levels is unchanged, and there is no direct feeding to 
#E      the ground state, the log{Ift} values for these five level        
#E      would be in the range 5.1 to 6.3.
