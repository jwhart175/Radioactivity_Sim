#  See ENSDF for {+45}Cl for identification of {+45}Cl isotope.           
#  Decay scheme of {+45}Cl |b{+-}n decay is not known.                    
#  2004Mr01: {+45}Cl produced by E=60 MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca beam fragmented 
#  on Be target and selected by the spectrometer LISE3 at GANIL. Isotopes 
#  implanted into double-sided Si detector surrounded by two coaxial HPGe 
#  and one EXOGRAM four-fold clover detector; two plastic scintillators   
#  for detecting |b radiation; The TONNERRE array for detecting neutrons. 
#  Measured E|g, I|g, n|g-coin. Deduced levels, branchings.               
#  Others: 1993So06, 1995So03
