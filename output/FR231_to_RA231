#  New conversion coefficients (BRICC) (August 9, 2012).                  
#  Calculated NR using new conversion coefficients (August 9, 2012).      
#  Recalculated B- feedings and logfts (August 10, 2012, April 3, 2012)   
#  231FR was produced by spallation of 1 GeV proton beam on uranium       
#  targets. The activity was mass-separated at ^CERN ^ISOLDE on-line      
#  separator, deposited on a magnetic tape, and then radiations           
#  counted at two stations. Measured G-ray singles, B- G coincidences,    
#  GG coincidences, conversion electrons singles and in coincidence       
#  with G rays. Detectors: Hyperpure germanium for G rays, plastic        
#  scintillators for B- particles, and a cooled Si(Li) with a magnetic    
#  mini-orange filter for conversion electrons. Additional measurements   
#  were done with the ^OSIRIS fission product separator in Sweden.        
#  Others: 1985HI02.
