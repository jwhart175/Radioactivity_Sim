#H TYP=FUL$AUT=Jean Blachot$CIT=NDS 109, 1383 (2008)$CUT=1-Mar-2008$      
#  2002RE14: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g using 3 large-volume HPGe detectors. 
#  Recoil products separated in mass and charge by Fragment Mass Analyzer 
#  1997SH13: The {+107}Sb was produced by fusion evaporation reactions    
#  induced by a 58NI beam on 50CR,52CR targets at GSI. On line mass       
#  separator with a ^"FEBIAD-^E" ion source. Measured G.                  
#  The level scheme is from 2002RE14
