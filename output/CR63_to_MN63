#  2005Ga01, 2003So21, 2001So07, 1999So20, AND 1999Le67 are

#  {+63}Cr produced in fragmentation of {+76}Ge{+30+} beam on a {+58}Ni   
#  target.  LISE3 achromatic spectrometer used to separate fragments;     
#  magnetic rigidity was tuned to optimize transmission of {+62}V         
#  {+64}Cr fragments.  Transmitted nuclei were identified by three        
#  consecutive Si detectors where two served for energy loss and          
#  time-of-flight measurements while the last determined their residual   
#  energies.                                                              
#  Measured E|g, I|g, I|b, |g|g, |b|g coin, |g(t), lifetimes with four Ge 
#  detectors placed around a thick Si telescope.  Half-lives determined by
#  fitting procedure involving five parameters: half-lives of mother,     
#  daughter and grand-daughter nuclei, the |b-efficiency and the          
#  background rate over the counting time.                                
#  All data are from 2005Ga01, unless otherwise stated.                   
#G E$Due to weak statistics, no |g|g coincidences established amongst any 
#G of the observed |g rays.                                               
#G E$Uncertainties assigned by compilers on basis of standard |DE{-|g}=2  
#G keV used for all other transitions observed in |b-decay studies from   
#G 2005Ga01.                                                              
#L E$No decay scheme could be established by 2005Ga01 as only half of the 
#L intensity of the entire |b-decay of {+63}Cr was observed through |g    
#L rays. The authors attribute this to either a lack of                   
#L statistics or to a high direct |b-feeding to the ground state of       
#L {+63}Mn.
