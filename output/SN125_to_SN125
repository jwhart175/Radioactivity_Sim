#  2008Lo07: {+125}Sn formed in relativistic fission reaction on {+238}U  
#  on a {+9}Be target at 750 A-MeV and by the fragmentation of {+136}Xe   
#  at 600 A-MeV. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, lifetimes. Using eight Cluster  
#  detectors from the RISING array                                        
#  2000Zh47,2004Br19: Some of {+125}Sn formed in the                      
#  {+124}Sn({+136}Xe,x|g), {+124}Sn({+238}U,x|g) and                      
#  {+232}Th({+136}Xe,x|g) reactions at E=665, 1324 and 833 MeV,           
#  respectively. The first two reactions essentially involve the particle 
#  transfer of a proton from the beam nucleus, to the target nucleus,     
#  {+124}Sn. The data of 2000Zh47 are also reported in 2004Br19
