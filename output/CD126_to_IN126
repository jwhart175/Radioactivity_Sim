#  The decay scheme is that proposed by 1978Ga18 and is based on EG sums  
#  and GG-coin. LOGFT value for the B- decay to the 688-KEV level         
#  is larger than 3.9 which is much smaller than LOGFT value              
#  in this mass region. If the 260-KEV level is fed by B- decay, spin     
#  of this level is 1 or 2. Even if the 260-KEV G were E2 or M2, IG would 
#  increase only by 20%. This value is not large enough to increase LOGFT 
#  value for the 688-KEV level to normal value. The                       
#  proposed level scheme, therefore, is thought to be still not complete  
#  and the evaluators give relative IG.
