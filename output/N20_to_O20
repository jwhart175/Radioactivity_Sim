#  1988Mu08: 20N ions from the fragmentation of a 45 MEV/u 48Ca beam on a 
#  181TA target at ^GANIL were filtered                                   
#  by the ^LISE spectrometer and implanted in a SI telescope.             
#  A delayed neutron emission probability of PN=53 +11-7 % was deduced.   
#  T1/2=100 MS +30-20 was also measured.                                  
#  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MEV proton bombardment of a     
#  232TH target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge   
#  filter and transferred to the ^TOFI spectrometer at ^LAMPF.            
#  The |b-delayed neutron probability PN=(66.1 50)% was deduced and       
#  T1/2 = 142 MS 19  was measured.                                        
#  A reanalysis of the (1991Re02) data, with additional data              
#  was published in the International conference on nuclear data for      
#  science and technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century,     
#  Gatlinburg, ^TN (United States),9-13 May 1994. The reanalysis indicates
#  Pn= (52.0 33)% and T1/2 = 129 ms 8.                                    
#  2006Su12: 20N ions from fragmentation of an 80 MEV/u 22NE beam on a Be 
#  target were selected by the ^NSCL ^A1200                               
#  fragment separator and implanted in a plastic scintillator. An array   
#  of curved plastic scintillator bars surrounded the implantation target.
#  The time-of-flight between the implantation detector (beta             
#  counter) and the neutron detector array determined the neutron         
#  energies. Two ^HPGE detectors measured |g rays.                        
#  The neutron emission probability Pn=(46 11)% was deduced from          
#  the neutron data. The analysis revealed seven neutron groups           
#  to 19O states. |g transitions among excited states in 20O and 19O      
#  were also observed. A detailed decay scheme is suggested by comparison 
#  of the |g transition intensities amongst the 19O levels, and a         
#  reasonable placement of neutron group intensties that could give       
#  an intensity balance. Low statistics apparently prevented a detailed   
#  beta-gamma-n comparison.                                               
#  T1/2=136 MS 3 was also measured.                                       
#  Comments: The measurements of 2006Su12 provide the only quantitative   
#  measure of 20O and 19O spectroscopy for levels and transitions involved
#  in the decay.  The %|b-1n=42.9 14 is deduced from feeding to           
#  19O^*(96, 1472), which are the only 19O levels are fed in the decay.   
#  Beta-decay to neutron                                                  
#  bound levels in 20O is found to comprise (53.8 13)% of decays          
#  with an additional                                                     
#  upper limit of 3.3% feeding 20O{-g.s.} directly.                       
#  The PN=^P{-1n}+2^P{-2n}=(52.0 33)% value from the revised              
#  zero-threshold measurement of 1991Re02 can be combined with            
#  ^P{-1n}=(42.9 14)% from 2006Su12 to estimate the value of ^P{-2n}=4.5%.
