#  Sources produced as fission products in {+235}U(n,f) (1979PiZP,        
#       1992TaZn, 1996Ta26) and in {+252}Cf(SF) (1993ZhZW, 1996GrZZ,      
#       1996GrZY, 1993Gr17,1987Gr12 all by same group).                   
#  Decay scheme is from 1996Ta26, |g data are from 1996Ta26 and           
#       1993ZhZW, and added |b- branches from 1997Gr09.  Although not     
#       stated explicitly, it appears that the placements of all |g's     
#       in 1996Ta26 are supported by |g|g coincidences; the |g|g          
#       coincidences shown in the scheme are reported by 1993ZhZW.        
#B LOGFT     The uncertainties do not take into account the               
#B      incompleteness of the decay scheme.                               
#B IB        Total absorption |g-ray spectrometer measurements give       
#B      the sum of the I{-|b-} to levels below 250 keV as 71.5% {I19}     
#B      (1997Gr09).  This result is used to determine I{-|b-}(0).         
#B IB        From total absorption |g-ray spectrometer (TAGS) spectra,    
#B      the |b- decay intensity as a function of the excitation energy    
#B      has been deduced (1997Gr09) independent of the |g-ray intensity   
#B      balances.  These data imply |b- decay to new levels in several    
#B      energy regions where there are no levels from the |g-ray data.    
#B      For the levels with depopulating |b's, the I{-|b-} are from       
#B      |g-ray intensity balances, but if the TAGS results differ         
#B      significantly, they are noted in a comment.                       
#G           The unplaced |g's are all from 1993ZhZW; the failure of      
#G      1996Ta26 to report them may suggest they do not belong to         
#G      this decay.                                                       
#G E         From weighted average of data of 1996Ta26 (115 |g's) and     
#G      1993ZhZW (70 |g's).  (The weighting is complicated by fact that   
#G      many reported uncertainties are given to only one digit and is    
#G      1 or 2).                                                          
#G RI        From 1996Ta26; other: 1993ZhZW. Where values from 1996Ta26   
#G      and 1993ZhZW are grossly different, this is noted.                
#G M,MR      From 1996Ta26, except those in [ ] are from the J|p's.       
#G           I(XK|a)=58 {I6} and I(XK|b)=14.7 {I14}.
