#  2002Je11,2002Je14: A Ta-foil target was bombarded by a 1.4-GeV proton  
#  beam to produce {+14}Be ions that were magnetically selected and were  
#  stopped in a polypropylene foil. Two Si detectors were used to detect  
#  |b decay products. |b-delayed charged particle emission is expected to 
#  be a {+14}Be |b-decay mode, since it has been observed for neutron-rich
#  He and Li isotopes. Shell-model calculations also place most of the |b 
#  strength within a few MeV below the Q{-|b} value in a region that is   
#  paticle unbound.                                                       
#  The authors calibrated the apparatus using two strong groups of        
#  |a particles emitted in {+20}Na |b-decay. An upper limit on |b-delayed 
#  |a particles of < 1.2 x 10{+-4} was observed along with weak evidence  
#  for |b-delayed tritons at intensity of 6 x 10{+-5} < B(|bt) < 4 x      
#  10{+-4} (at 95% confidence level). These tiny experimental intensities 
#  disagree with the shell-model calculations. Part of this discrepancy   
#  might be due to the poor knowledge on the possible |b-delayed          
#  multi-neutron branches.
