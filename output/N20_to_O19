#  1988Mu08: 20N ions from the fragmentation of a 45 MEV/u 48CA beam on a 
#  181TA target at ^GANIL were filtered by the ^LISE spectrometer and     
#  implanted in a SI telescope. The telescope was surrounded by a thin    
#  scintillator to detect |b-rays and a segmented ^NE102A 4|p neutron     
#  array with an energy threshold of 350 KEV. Following implantation of   
#  20N in the telescope the cyclotron frequency was scrambled and the     
#  decay event was measured. A delayed neutron emission probability of    
#  PN=53 +11-7 % was deduced. T1/2=100 MS +30-20 was also measured.       
#  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MEV proton bombardment of a     
#  232TH target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge   
#  filter and transferred to the ^TOFI spectrometer at ^LAMPF. The        
#  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
#  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderate 3HE    
#  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
#  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
#  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
#  detected in the zero-threshold counter. The |b-delayed neutron         
#  probability PN=(66.1 50)% was deduced. T1/2 = 142 MS 19  was also      
#  measured. A reanalysis of the (1991Re02) data, with additional data    
#  was published in the International conference on nuclear data for      
#  science and technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century,     
#  Gatlinburg, ^TN (United States), 9-13 May 1994. The reanalysis         
#  indicates PN=(52.0 33)% and T1/2 = 129 MS 8.                           
#  2006Su12: 20N ions from fragmentation of an 80 MEV/u 22NE beam on a Be 
#  target were selected by the ^NSCL ^A1200 fragment separator and        
#  implanted in a plastic scintillator. An array of curved plastic        
#  scintillator bars surrounded the implantation target.                  
#  The time-of-flight between the implantation detector (beta counter) and
#  the neutron detector array determined the neutron energies. Two ^HPGE  
#  detectors measured |g rays.                                            
#  The neutron emission probability PN=(46 11)% was deduced from          
#  the neutron data. The analysis revealed seven neutron groups           
#  to 19O states. |g transitions among excited states in 20O and 19O      
#  were also observed. A detailed decay scheme is suggested by comparison 
#  of the |g transition intensities amongst the 19O levels, and a         
#  reasonable placement of neutron group intensties that could give       
#  an intensity balance. Low statistics apparently prevented a detailed   
#  |b-|g-n comparison. T1/2=136 MS 3 was also measured.                   
#  Comments: The measurements of 2006Su12 provide the only quantitative   
#  measure of 20O and 19O spectroscopy for levels and transitions involved
#  in the decay.  The %|b-1n=42.9 14 is deduced; furthermore, only        
#  19O^*(96, 1472) levels are fed in the 1n decay. Beta-decay to neutron  
#  bound levels in 20O is found to comprise (53.8 13)% of decays          
#  with an additional upper limit of 3.3% feeding 20O{-g.s.} directly.    
#  The PN=^P{-1n}+2^P{-2n}=(52.0 33)% value from the revised              
#  zero-threshold measurement of 1991Re02 can be combined with            
#  ^P{-1n}=(42.9 14)% from 2006Su12 to estimate the value of ^P{-2n} AP   
#  4.5%. The ^P{-2n} contribution in the decay was not considered when the
#  limit on direct feeding of 20O{-g.s.} was deduced.
