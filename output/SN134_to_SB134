#  {+134}Sn isotope produced in UC{-2}(n,f) reaction following bombardment
#  of a W rod with proton pulses at E=1.4 GeV.  Sn isotopes ionized by    
#  resonance ionization laser ion source (RILIS) and separated using the  
#  ISOLDE general purpose mass separator (GPS).                           
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g coin, |g(t), |g|g(t) with five large Ge  
#  detectors.                                                             
#B LOGFT$ Deduced by evaluators                                           
#B IB(Y)$Followed by emission of B- delayed neutrons.                     
#L E$ Deduced by evaluators from least-squares fit to |g-ray energies.    
#L J$ All assignments changed to same as in Adopted dataset and           
#L placed in parentheses (Singh)                                          
#L J$ Assignments based on assumption that E2 transitions will be weak or 
#L nonexistent in {+134}Sb due to small collective enhancement,           
#L unless otherwise stated.                                               
#L J(X)$From log| {Ift} and |g rays to JPI=2- and JPI=1- levels only.     
#L E(Y)$Multiplet de-excited by emission of B- delayed neutrons           
#L (1990Fo03).
