#  2002Ur02: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|g(|q), |g|g(directional linear   
#  polarization) using EUROGAM2 array of Compton-suppressed Ge detectors  
#  at Strasbourg facility. K-shell conversion coefficient of 197.6|g      
#  measured by triple |g coin using Ge and LEPS detectors and comparing   
#  K-x-ray and |g-ray intensities. Identification of |g rays in {+139}I   
#  nuclide was based on observed correlations between |g rays in {+139}I  
#  and in complementary fission fragments of Tc isotopes of mass 105-107. 
#G $ A{-2} and A{-4} coefficients are from |g|g(|q) data.                 
#G M$ From |g|g(|q) and directional linear polarization measurements.     
#G In |g|g(q) data, expected A{-2}=+0.10, A{-4}=-0.01 for quadrupole      
#G (|DJ=2)-quadrupole (|DJ=2) cascade and A{-2}=-0.07 for quadrupole      
#G (|DJ=2)-dipole (|DJ=1) cascade                                         
#L E$From least-squares fit to E|g's, assuming |D(E|g)=0.3 keV            
#L for each E|g quoted to nearest tenth of a keV and 1 keV otherwise      
#L J$ As proposed by 2002Ur02 based on systematics for g.s. and 209.5     
#L level and multipolarities of transitions from higher levels            
#L together with band associations. All assignments in 'adopted levels'   
#L are the same except that all are given in parentheses there since      
#L the g.s. spin-parity is not based on solid arguments.                  
#L BAND(A)$ GS band                                                       
#L BAND(B)$ Band based on 9/2+
