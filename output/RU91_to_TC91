#  2004DE40: 91RU SOURCE FROM 58NI(36AR{+10+},2pn), E(36AR)158 MeV beam   
#  degraded to 130 MEV mid-target using a set of tantalum degraders of    
#  varying thicknesses placed in the beam line (to capitalize on a 28 mb  
#  maximum cross-section, as calculated using ^HIVAP code). Nuclei        
#  recoiling out of the target were stopped and neutralized by 500 mbar of
#  purified Ar gas inside a cell. Reaction products were ionized          
#  selectively, according to Z, using two dye lasers tuned to the resonant
#  atomic transitions of Rh and Ru, thereby enhancing strongly the        
#  ionization and, thus, extraction of these nuclei.  The                 
#  laser-ionized nuclei were then guided towards the ^LISOL mass          
#  separator by a sextupole ion guide. Measured EG (<4 MEV), IG, GG COIN, 
#  IB, BG COIN, isotope ^T{-1/2} with two HPGe detectors arranged in a    
#  compact configuration around |b-sensitive plastic DE-E detectors that  
#  enclosed the tape station.                                             
#  1983KO43: Source from 54FE(40CA,2PN). GE(LI) detector.                 
#E TI,LOGFT  |b-feeding to ground and excited states in 91TC was          
#E calculated by 2004DE40 based on I(511G) from annihilation.             
#E Since all I(511G) that could not be associated with |g events          
#E visible in the |g-ray spectra was attributed to the GS B branch,       
#E branches to weakly populated states and to states deexcited by         
#E EG>4 MEV transitions may have been overlooked, and the deexcitation    
#E of those levels may perturb the intensity balance at the levels below  
#E them.  THUS, LOGFT VALUES SHOWN HERE MAY be UNDERESTIMATED.            
#E TI IMBALANCE AT EXCITED STATES IS GIVEN IN COMMENTS AND IS CONSISTENT  
#E WITH (BUT LESS PRECISE) THAN BRANCHING DEDUCED BY 2004DE40.
