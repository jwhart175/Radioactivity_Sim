#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b-correlated |g, half-life using an array    
#  of six segmented Ge detectors. {+55}Ti isotope was produced by         
#  fragmentation of  140-MeV {+86}Kr{+34+} beam in a Be target.           
#  The secondary fragments were selected in the A1900 fragment            
#  recoil-separator, and implanted in a double-sided Si microstrip        
#  detector to detect |b particles from decay of fragments.
