#  1997KU20: the 227RN activity was produced by spallation of 1-GEV       
#  protons on a 232TH target and subsequently mass separated              
#  in the ISOLDE mass-separator. The separated activity was               
#  deposited on a tape transport for G-ray, conversion electron, and B-   
#  measurements. The assignment of G rays to 227RN was based on its       
#  half-life of about 20 S. Measured EG, RI, GG coin, BG coin, ICE,       
#  BG(T), and BGG(T). Detectors: hyper-pure germanium detectors;          
#  the TESSA array of 12 COMPTON-suppressed germanium detectors for       
#  G rays; a plastic scintillator for B- particles; and a                 
#  mini-orange magnetic spectrometer for conversion electrons.            
#  Deduced levels half-life and G-ray multipolarities.                    
#  Other measurements:                                                    
#  1989BO11: measured EG, RI, BG coin. Detector: plastic scintillator for 
#  B- particles, and a hyper-pure germanium detector for G rays. Authors  
#  reported 33 G rays, none of them placed in the level scheme.           
#  1986BO35: the activity was produced by spallation of 600-MEV protons on
#  targets of {+232}Th. Assignment to {+227}Rn is based on mass           
#  separation, and on the genetic relationship with its daughter nucleus  
#  227FR. Measured B-. Detector: plastic scintillator (1986BO35).         
#  Measured XK intensities of 790 25 (XKA2), 1260 50 (XKA1),              
#  453 20 (XKB1P), and 128 10 (XKB2P) agree well with the following       
#  values calculated by the evaluator using the computer program          
#  ^RADLST: 740 36 (XKA2), 1214 59 (XKA1), and                            
#  562 28 (XKB1P + XKB2P). This agreement shows that most G rays with     
#  EG GE 101 KEV (the K-binding energy in francium) have correct          
#  multipolarities and accurate mixing ratios. The normalization of the   
#  decay scheme, however, cannot be done accurately because possible B-   
#  feedings to low energy levels are unknown. Nevertheless, 1997KU20      
#  normalized the decay scheme assuming no B- feeding to any level below  
#  40 KEV. Except for the GS (1/2+), this assumption is unrealistic since 
#  these levels have spins of 3/2 or 5/2, and the parent nucleus 227RN    
#  is expected to have a spin of 5/2. As 1997KU20 pointed out, their      
#  B- and G-ray deduced absolute intensities are just limits.             
#  Others: 1989BO11, 1986BO35.                                            
#L J$Spin, parity, and rotational band assignments are based mostly       
#L on G-ray multipolarities and the band structure expected from the      
#L reflection-symmetric rotor model, including an octupole deformation.   
#L Only the better established rotational bands are presented in

#L J$Although octupole deformations are small in this region, nuclear     
#L states are no longer fully characterized by single Nilsson orbitals.
