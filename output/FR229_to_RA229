#  229FR activity produced by spallation of 1-GeV protons on an uranium   
#  target. Source was produced and mass separated at the ^ISOLDE-PSB      
#  mass separator and deposited on to a moving tape.  Measured B-, G-ray  
#  singles and BG COIN, BGG COIN, and |b|g|g|g COIN. Detectors: plastic   
#  scintillator for B- particles; high-purity germanium for G rays.       
#  Measured conversion electrons in singles and G-electron coincidence    
#  experiments. Detectors: A magnetic spectrometer coupled to a Si(Li)    
#  cooled detector for conversion electrons;high-purity germanium         
#  for G rays. Measured conversion coefficients, deduced G-ray            
#  multipolarities. Measured BGG(t) triple coincidences, determined       
#  levels half-life.                                                      
#B IB$Deduced by evaluators from G-ray transition intensity balance to    
#B levels in 229RA. Total B- feeding to levels above 213 keV is           
#B 92% 3. The remaining 8%  2 feeds mostly the 142.7-(1/2+),              
#B 168.8-(3/2+), and 213.0-keV(3/2+) levels. Evaluators have considered   
#B very imprecise and inconsistent with G-ray data the individual values  
#B deduced for the B- feeding to each of these levels.                    
#G M,MR$From measured conversion coefficients.                            
#L E$Deduced by evaluators from least-squares fit to G-ray energies.      
#L J$Spin and parity assignments are based on G-ray multipolarities and   
#L on rotational structure.  Because of the high octupole components in   
#L the wave functions of low-energy states, rotational levels are seen    
#L with partners of the same K angular momentum projection and opposite   
#L parities ("parity doublets.") This interpretation has been confirmed   
#L by the enhanced E1 G-ray transition probabilities between parity       
#L pair states.
