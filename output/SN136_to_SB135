#  2002Sh08: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, lifetimes, delayed neutron          
#  probability using high-efficiency Mainz neutron long counter with      
#  3-ring concentric array of 50 {+3}He proportional counters, |b         
#  detector, and Pb-shielded Ge detectors. No |g rays were seen from      
#  {+136}Sn |b{+-}n decay                                                 
#  2007Ma40: High purity {+136}Sn beam extracted at ISOLDE facility.      
#  Measured |b, |g, |g|g coin, |b|g|g(t) using five detectors: three fast 
#  timing scintillators (LaBr{-3}(Ce) and BaF{-2}) and two large-volume Ge
#  detectors. Advanced time-delay (ATD) method used to measure            
#  lifetimes. 2007Ma40 is a conference paper and the authors state        
#  that analysis is still in progress.
