#  92Y produced using the 9BE(238U,X) reaction. 238U                      
#  beam produced at E=8.00 MeV/nucleon by the ^K500 and ^K1200            
#  cyclotrons at the National Superconducting Laboratory at Michigan      
#  State University. Reaction products were separated using the ^A1900    
#  fragment separator and detected using two parallel plate avalanche     
#  counters, a Si DE detector, four Si detectors, and a plastic           
#  scintillator. Measurements of the time-of-flight, ^B|r and total       
#  kinetic energy were used to determine the atomic number, mass number   
#  and charge state of reaction products. |g's were detected with one     
#  HPGe detector. Half-lives were measured using the time difference      
#  between implantation events and HPGe events, a technique which was not 
#  suitable for measuring half-lives of less than 500 ns. Measured        
#  particle spectra, EG, IG, (particle)-|g coincidence and half-lives of  
#  isomeric states. Deduced isomer.                                       
#  AUTHORS IDENTIFIED ISOMER with half-life of 4.2 US +8-6, but no level  
#  scheme was proposed
