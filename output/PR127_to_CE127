#L E         From a least-squares fit to E{-|g}'s.  The energy            
#L of the first (5/2+) state is 8.1 {I9} and this level is fixed for the  
#L least-squares fit, 0.9 keV were added in quadratic form on the |DE     
#L in band(B) and band(C) (evaluator).                                    
#L E$1994Se13 and 1995Os03 report the 29.56 {I5} |g to be delayed more    
#L than 10 |ms, being not coincide with other prompt |g's. On the other   
#L hand, 1995Gi12 report the M1 28.8 |g coincides with several |g's,      
#L and attributed this prompt |g from (3/2+) to (1/2+) level in band(A).  
#L 1995Gi12 observe prompt |g's which coincide with the |b-rays from      
#L {+127}Pr decay, and do not report any delayed |g.                      
#L One of authors (T.Sekine) in 1995Os03 gave evaluator an e-mail at      
#L 2 Sept.2010. He says that, after the 1995Os03 being reported, the      
#L weak 28.8 |g is found resolved from 29.56 |g, and confirmed the 28.8   
#L |g coincides with 674 |g and Ce K x ray. In 1997, B. Firestone proposed
#L in ENSDF file on A=127 (added file in 1993Ki01) that the 29.56 |g      
#L is the E1 transition from 11/2{+-} level (the head of band(C)) to      
#L 5/2{++} level (the head of band(B)). Further, evaluator notes that     
#L if 29.56 |g is E1 and is delayed more than 10 |ms, the order of        
#L BE1/BE1W becomes equal or smaller than 10{+-7} and this order for      
#L E1 transition is permissible from the examples in this mass region.
