#  Level scheme is that of 1983AR15. ^TAGS data with a number of

#B IB (in %) in addition to the discrete levels listed. 880 KEV { 1.56};

#B The ^TAGS spectrum of 148CE 56s decay,                                 
#B while predominantly 148CE, is estimated to contain LT 10% contribution 
#B from 148PR 2.0 M decay. A simultaneous analysis of both these nuclides 
#B was done, and the authors feel that in the energy range from AP 750 KEV
#B to AP 1300 KEV, there is some ambiguity in the final results because   
#B of overlapping peaks. Since the resolution of the ^TAGS system is      
#B typically 50-100 KEV, the intensity assigned to a pseudolevel may      
#B represent B- feeding to a single level or a group of levels. The       
#B same limitation applies to the intensity assigned to a known level,    
#B since it could include feeding to known or unknown levels in the       
#B resolution energy range.
