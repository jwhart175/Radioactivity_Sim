#  1986Sz06: {+172}W produced by {+165}Ho({+14}N,7n) E=117 MeV. Measured  
#  T{-1/2}, E|g, I|g. Three |g rays of 424, 547, and 631 keV were assigned
#  to {+172}W decay. This work confirmed only two |g rays out of 38 |g    
#  rays reported by 1974CaZR. Some of the other |g rays were assigned to  
#  {+173}W decay by 1986Sz06. Absolute (per 100 decays of the parent)     
#  |g-ray intensities are given for a few |g rays. These values cannot    
#  be considered as reliable since the measured half-life of {+172}W      
#  decay is reported by 1986Sz06 as 8.0 min {I4}, closer to the adopted   
#  half-life of 7.6 min {I2} for the decay of {+173}W                     
#  1974CaZR (also thesis by 1974CaZI): isotope produced by                
#  {+176}Hf({+3}He,7n) E=72 MeV. Measured T{-1/2}, E|g, I|g,              
#  |g|g, |g|g(t), ce, anti-Compton spectrometer. 1974CaZR assigned 38     
#  |g rays to {+172}W decay, but 1986Sz06 confirmed only three |g rays    
#  of 424, 547 and 631 which belonged to {+172}W decay. 1986Sz06 pointed  
#  out that many |g rays reported by 1974CaZR actually belonged to        
#  {+173}W decay. Similar conclusions were drawn by 1990Me12. However,    
#  1990Me12 reported many new |g rays. The following |g rays

#G E,RI$From 1990Me12. For comparison, intensities of |g rays             
#G are given under comments. The intensities given by 1974CaZR are        
#G normalized to 100 for a 130.2|g, which does not seem to belong to      
#G {+172}W decay. Normalization relative to 423|g suggests that I|g values
#G from 1974CaZR should be multiplied by |?1.8 for normalization of data  
#G between 1990Me12 and 1974CaZR. I|g(423|g)/I|g(547|g)=1.05 (1986Sz06)   
#G disagrees with 2.7 from 1990Me12. The 547|g was not reported by
