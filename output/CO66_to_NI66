#  2000MU10: 66CO produced by irradiation of 238U foils with 30-MeV       
#  protons.  66CO was separated from other recoiling fission products     
#  using a laser-ionization isotope-separation method. These isotopes     
#  were then mass separated. Measured BG COIN and GG COIN. Detectors:     
#  Ge hyperpure and plastic scintillators.                                
#  1998BO06: 66CO produced by irradiation of a thick W target with a      
#  11.5-MeV/^A 76GE beam. On-line mass separation. Measured EG, RI,       
#  BG COIN, GG COIN. Detectors: hyperpure Ge and plastic scintillators.   
#  1988BO06 reported a 471.3 keV 6 G ray with RI=23 4. 2000MU10 searched  
#  for this G ray but could not find it. Thus, its existence remains      
#  to be confirmed, and thus there is no support for levels at 2916       
#  and 2445 keV associated with this transition.                          
#  Other measurement: 1985Bo49.
