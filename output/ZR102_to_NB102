#B LOGFT$Values are deduced by the evaluator using "LOGFT"                
#B code available at www.nndc.bnl.gov; value of x is assumed as 0 for     
#B this calculation. From |b|g counting the ground state feeding upper    
#B limit was deduced to be 59% 3. All values should be treated as lower   
#B limits since possible feedings to higher levels are unknown.           
#B For the calculation of conversion coefficients all low-energy          
#B transitions for which the multipolarity could not be determined        
#B experimentally are considered [M1] because from systematics and        
#B structure point of view M1 is a good guess as multipolarity            
#B IB$All values should be treated as upper limits since possible
