#  1975Ad09 (and 1985Ad12): {+163}Yb isotope obtained by bombardment of   
#  tantalum by a 660-MeV proton beam followed by chemical separation.     
#  Measured |g, ce, prompt and delayed |g|g coin, |b|g coin. 1985Ad12

#  The decay scheme and all data, except as noted, are from 1975Ad09 as   
#  modified by 1985Ad12. The major modifications were: new                
#  levels at 175 and 254, removal of levels at 224 and 288, introduction  
#  of 5/2[402] and 3/2[411] bands, and changes in spins and parities      
#  of the 137, 498, and 559 levels.

#E balance of -4.8 {I24}. These discrepancies are most likely due to
