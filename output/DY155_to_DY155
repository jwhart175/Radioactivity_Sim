#  1970Bo02: the source was produced in the 155GD(3HE,3NG) reaction, using
#  a pulsed beam. Measured EG, RI, ICE, delayed G, delayed CE. The        
#  activity was assigned to 155DY by comparison of the measured EG        
#  with known values reported in the 155HO EC decay.                      
#  Although 1970Bo02 correctly associated the isomeric state with the     
#  11/2[505] NILSSON orbital, they did not propose ^a decay scheme for    
#  it. The decay scheme shown here is that worked up by the evaluator     
#  and relies heavily on the level-scheme information obtained from the   
#  155HO EC decay.

#G RI        The relative RI values for the G's deexciting a given level  
#G are those observed in the 155HO EC decay. The RI values of the G's     
#G deexciting a given level, relative to those deexciting other levels,   
#G have been adjusted to provide a suitable intensity balance at each     
#G level.                                                                 
#G RI        The G intensity scale has been chosen so that the sum of the 
#G TI values of the transitions deexciting the 6-US isomer is 100%. Note  
#G that these values depend significantly on the TI value of the 9.1 G.   
#G This value, relative to those of the other transitions deexciting the  
#G isomer, was chosen to reproduce the relative RI values of the 138      
#G and the 147 (and 79) G's. It is much smaller than what would be        
#G expected from the CE data of 1979Al31 and 1979Ab18 on the EC decay     
#G of 155HO. See the discussion under the 9.1 G in the 155HO EC decay     
#G data set.
