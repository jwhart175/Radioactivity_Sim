#  From systematics, the existence of two Y isomers is                    
#  expected. The production method ({+235}U(n,F)) favors the              
#  high-spin isomer, so probably mainly the decay of the high-spin {+102}Y
#  isomer has been observed by 1983Sh13. Existence of two {+102}Y isomers 
#  has been confirmed by the different I(152|g)/I(326|g) ratios given by  
#  1983Sh13 and 1991Hi02. However in a recent paper of 2007Ch07 a high    
#  spin isomer is not mentioned
