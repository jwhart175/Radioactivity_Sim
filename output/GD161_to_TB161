#  1975HiZE: Abstract; saw 45 G's above 600 keV, but no data given. Not   
#       published.                                                        
#  1976Hn01: G singles and GG coincidences measured with Ge detectors.    
#       Report 29 G's below 600 keV and none above that. Deduce G         
#       multipolarities from ECK's using CE data of 1959Sc29.             
#B E         Measured E(|b{+-}) value is from 1966Zy02.                   
#B IB,LOGFT  I|b{+-} values are computed from |g-intensity balances and   
#B the I|g values are normalized to give a total I|b{+-} of 100%. They    
#B are not normalized to give 100% feeding of the ground state because    
#B this value depends significantly on the very uncertain |a of the 56|g. 
#B I|b{+-} and log| {Ift} values are not given for levels above 600 keV,  
#B as the I|b{+-} values are too small (|<0.04%) to be meaningful, since  
#B the unplaced |g's can change the values significantly.                 
#B The total I|b{+-} given is 99.4%.                                      
#B IB        The calculated I|b{+-}(g.s.)=8% {I12} is not included since  
#B it is assumed that this value results from an error in the             
#B transition intensity of the 56-keV |g. This assumption is              
#B supported by the calculated I|b{+-}(56)=-7% {I12}. See comments on     
#B |a for the 56|g.                                                       
#G E,RI      From 1975Ga16; the nine doubtful unplaced |g's and one       
#G possible sum peak (1975Ga16) have been omitted.                        
#G Others: 1976Hn01, 1974OkZW, 1966Zy02, and 1966FuZZ.                    
#G M         From K| x ray/|g and L{-1}/M ratios for 56-keV |g (1959Sc29  
#G and 1976Hn01) and from |a(K)exp's (1976Hn01), using ce data of         
#G 1959Sc29 for all other |g's with the |g and ce data scaled to the      
#G theoretical M1 value for the 56-keV |g. The precision of the           
#G ce data (1959Sc29)                                                     
#G is judged by the evaluator to be sufficient to distinguish between E1  
#G and M1+E2 transitions, but not between M1 and E2 transitions.          
#G MR        From |g|g(|q) results of 1974OkZW.                           
#G E(M)      Authors (1975Ga16) indicate |g is doubtful even though it is 
#G placed in scheme and intensity is >0.                                  
#G RI(H)     This I|g and the |a result in an intensity for the |b{+-}    
#G feeding of the 56-keV level of -7% {I12}. If the theoretical |a for an 
#G M1 |g is used, this computed I|b{+-} becomes -23%. To obtain an        
#G intensity balance, I|g would need to increase by about 10%.            
#L           Decay scheme is primarily that of 1975Ga16, which is the only
#L report of levels above 750 keV. Below 750 keV, similar schemes are     
#L given by 1976Hn01, 1974OkZW, 1966Zy02, and 1966FuZZ.                   
#L           The following data have been measured: |g-ray energies and   
#L intensities (1975Ga16, also 1976Hn01,1966Zy02,1966FuZZ), level         
#L half-lives (1964Lo09,1965Ma24,1967Ma33,1969Be54), |g|g coincidences    
#L (1966Zy02,1969Be54,1974OkZW,1975Ga16,1976Hn01), and multipolarities    
#L from ce data (1959Sc29,1976Hn01) and from |g|g(|q) data (1974OkZW).    
#L           The |g|g-coincidence data on the drawing are from 1976Hn01.  
#L E         From least-squares fit to |g energies.                       
#L J         The J{+|p} and band assignments are from {+161}Tb            
#L  Adopted Levels. They agree with those from the {+161}Gd |b{+-}        
#L  decay results of 1975Ga16 and are based on |g multipolarities         
#L  and expected band structure. Other J{+|p} and band assignments from   
#L  1975Ga16 which are not adopted are given in comments.                 
#L T         From {+161}Tb Adopted Levels. All data are from this decay.
