#  2013Ru07: {+241}Pu,{+241}Am(n,F|g),E=thermal, at the high flux reactor 
#  of the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble. Fission fragments were        
#  separated by Lohengrin mass spectrometer, identified and selected by a 
#  split-anode ionization chamber. Conversion electron and low-energy     
#  photon spectra were recorded using Si(Li) detectors. Delayed |g rays   
#  were detected by two Clover Ge detectors placed perpendicular to the   
#  ionization chamber. Events related to {+97}Rb were identified          
#  by K x-rays in the Si(Li) detector and energy loss in the ionization   
#  chamber. Measured E|g, |g(fission fragment)-coin, K x-rays, t{-1/2},   
#  |a(K). Deduced an isomer in {+97}Rb and multipolarity of |g transition.
#  Comparison with Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) and quasi particle-      
#  rotor model calculations (QPRM). See also 2013RuZX thesis by the       
#  first author of 2013Ru07                                               
#  2012Ka36: {+9}Be({+238}U,F|g),E=345 MeV/nucleon at RIBF accelerator    
#  complex at RIKEN facility. Fission fragments were separated and        
#  analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal plane of           
#  ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper.  
#  Particle identification was achieved by |DE-TOF-B|r method.            
#  Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were detected by three     
#  clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, isomer                  
#  half-life. Deduced level, J|p
