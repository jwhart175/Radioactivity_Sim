#  2005Li53: {+57}Ti isotope produced in fragmentation of {+86}Kr{+34+}   
#  beam on a {+9}Be target.  Secondary fragments were selected using the  
#  A1900 fragment separator.  Fragment identification was performed by a  
#  combination of multiple energy-loss signals and time of flight method. 
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|b(t), lifetime with 12 Ge detectors from   
#  the MSU segmented Ge array and double-sided Si microstrip detector.    
#B IB$ deduced by the evaluator from |g-ray intensity balances and the    
#B ground state feeding deduced by 2005Li53 from the total number of      
#B {+57}Ti nuclei implanted in the Double-sided Si microstrip detector    
#B (DSSD). The listed |b feedings should be treated as apparent values    
#B LOGFT$ All values are considered as lower limits.                      
#L E$ from least-squares fit to E|g's
