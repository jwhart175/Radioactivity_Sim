#  1986Ek01 (also 1977Al17,1974Gr29): Zn isotopes separated as fission    
#  fragments at the OSIRIS ISOL facility (Studsvik). Measured G, GG,      
#  G(T), BG following the decay of 75ZN. Planar HPGE, coaxial Ge,         
#  scintillator and Si detectors used to detect |g and |b particles.      
#  The |g multipolarities were deduced from the measured CC.
