#  GEV/NUCLEON 208PB INCIDENT ON 2.526 gm/cm{+2} 9BE TARGET BACKED BY Nb  
#  FOIL; FRAGMENT SEPARATOR (ACHROMATIC MODE; Al DEGRADER MID-FOCAL PLANE,
#  SCINTILLATOR FOR TOF AND POSITION MEASUREMENT, Nb FOIL TO MAXIMIZE     
#  ELECTRON STRIPPING); FRAGMENTS STOPPED IN PLASTIC STOPPER AT CENTER OF 
#  ^RISING G SPECTROMETER ARRAY; PHOTONS FROM METASTABLE EXCITED STATES OF
#  STOPPED FRAGMENTS OBSERVED FOR HALF-LIVES AP 10 NS TO 1 MS; MEASURED

#  2005CA02: ISOMER FROM fragmentation of 1 GEV/NUCLEON 208PB beam        
#  STRIKING A 9BE TARGET AT ENTRANCE TO fragment separator;               
#  two multi-wire proportional counters, for position                     
#  measurements; two scintillation detectors, providing time-of-flight    
#  and position information and a further two scintillators and an        
#  ionization chamber (^MUSIC) for energy loss measurements; FRAGMENTS    
#  STOPPED IN Al PLATE AT FOCAL PLANE BETWEEN 4 CLOVER Ge DETECTORS       
#  (providing 16 independent Ge crystals); measured EG, IG, GG COIN,      
#  GG(t).  For each Ge crystal, the energy and time of the first          
#  |g-ray event was recorded after the arrival of a heavy ion, up         
#  to a maximum time of 75 US.  SEE ALSO 2000POZY, 2001CA13.
