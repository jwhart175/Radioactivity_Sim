#  2006Mo07: Activity was produced by fragmentation of {+136}Xe{++50,51}  
#  (E=121.8 MeV/nucleon) on Be. Particle identification was performed.    
#  The products were passed to a mass spectrometer,                       
#  position sensitive detector, stacked Si detectors and TOF arrangement. 
#  |b-delayed neutrons were detected within the neutron                   
#  emission ratio observer; Implantation and decay events were time       
#  stamped and correlated. deduced T{-1/2} and P{-n}
