#  2011Ni01: {+108}Y nuclide produced in Be({+238}U,F) reactions at       
#  E=345 MeV/nucleon produced by the cascade operation of the RBIF complex
#  of accelerators at RIKEN. Target=550 mg/cm{+2}. Identification of      
#  {+108}Y made on the basis of magnetic rigidity, time-of-flight and     
#  energy loss. The separated nuclei were implanted in a nine-layer       
#  double-sided silicon-strip detector (DSSSD). Correlations were recorded
#  between the heavy ions and |b rays. The half-life of {+108}Y isotope   
#  was measured from the correlated ion-|b decay curves and maximum       
#  likelihood analysis technique. In the analysis of the decay curve,     
#  |b-detection efficiency, background rate, daughter and granddaughter   
#  (including those populated in delayed neutron decays) half-lives, and  
#  |b-delayed neutron emission probabilities were considered. Comparison  
#  of measured half-lives with FRDM+QRPA and KTUY+GT2 calculations        
#  2011Su11: Produced at the radioactive isotope beam factory (RIBF) of   
#  the RIKEN Nishina Center via the in-flight fission of {+238}U          
#  beams having an energy of 345 MeV/nucleon. Used 3 mm thick Be          
#  production target and BigRIPS I|g-beam separator to separate the       
#  fission fragments. Beam particles identified using the magnetic        
#  rigidity, B|r, time-of-flight, and energy loss which was determined    
#  by the focal plane detectors of BigRIPS and the ZeroDegree             
#  spectrometer.  Identified particles were implanted in nine stacked     
#  double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSD) surrounded by two LaBr{-3} 
#  detectors and four Compton-suppressed clover-type Ge detectors each    
#  having a plastic scintillation detector in front to eliminate          
#  background in |g-ray spectrum caused by |b-ray events by taking an     
#  anticoincidence. |b-decay events selected using position and time      
#  correlations between implantation and |b-ray events.                   
#  2015Lo04: {+108}Y nuclide produced at RIBF-RIKEN facility in           
#  {+9}Be({+238}U,F) reaction at E=345 MeV/nucleon with an average        
#  intensity of 6|*10{+10} ions/s. Measured half-life of {+108}Y
