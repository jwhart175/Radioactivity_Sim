#  2003Ma02: {+57}V obtained from fragmentation of the primary beam of    
#  {+86}Kr{+14++} at E=140 MeV/nucleon in a thick Be target followed by   
#  separation of fragment isotopes based on atomic mass and atomic number.
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g using six Ge detectors from the NSCL     
#  SeGA array                                                             
#  Placement of |g rays is from energy sums, no |b|g|g coincidence events 
#  were detected in 2003Ma02                                              
#  1998So03: {+57}V activity produced by the fragmentation of 64.5        
#  MeV/nucleon {+65}Cu beam impinging on a {+9}Be target and subsequent   
#  mass separation using the lise3 spectrometer. Measured T{-1/2} from    
#  |b{+-} singles and |b-|g coincidence decay curves. Three |g rays       
#  were detected at 267 {I4}, 700 {I50} and 900 {I50} keV with            
#  intensities of 60, 30, and 30%, QRPA calculations                      
#  1998Am04: T{-1/2} measurement and production of {+57}V

#B IB,LOGFT$ Apparent |b feedings, thus log {Ift} values should be        
#B considered (by the evaluator) as lower limits only, thus no            
#B uncertainties in log {Ift} values are listed                           
#G RI$I|g/100 decays were deduced (by 2003Ma02) from the number of        
#G observed |g rays, the |g-ray efficiency curve and the number of        
#G {+57}V implants correlated with |b decays                              
#G E(A)$ In {+14}C({+48}Ca,|an|g), a 1581 level was shown to decay by     
#G 639.1|g and 1313.8|g. In |b{+-} decay,
