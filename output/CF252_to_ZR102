#  2008Li45: Experiment performed at LBNL. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g,       
#  |g|g(|q) using GAMMASPHERE array of 102 HPGe detectors with Compton    
#  suppression.                                                           
#  1997Ha64,1995HaZZ: {+252}Cf, {+242}Pu(SF): measured: SF-decay data,    
#  E|g, I|g. Deduced: {+102}Zr levels, J|p, band structure                
#  1991Ho16,1990Ho12: {+248}Cm SF. Measured: E|g, I|g, |g|g. Deduced:     
#  {+102}Zr levels, J|p.                                                  
#  1995Du10: {+248}Cm SF. Measured: E|g, |g|g|g using eurogam. Deduced:   
#  {+102}Zr levels J|p, neutron pairing strength                          
#  1971Ch44: measured: fragment kinetic energies, E|g, I|g;               
#  (fission)|g-, (fission)x-ray-, |g|g- and (K| x ray)|g-coin.            
#  1971Ch44 gives also intensities per fission and K x-ray per fission    
#  The results of 1980ChZM are based on {+254}Cf SF decay.

#G E,RI$ From 2008Li45 they state that the uncertainty ranges from 5% for 
#G strong transitions to 30% for weak transitions. The evaluator assign   
#G as follows: 5% for I|g>5, 15% for I|g=2-5 and 30% for I|g<2.           
#L E$ From least-squares fit to E|g's (by evaluator) using uncertainty    
#L of 0.3 keV for each |g ray                                             
#L J$From |g|g, |g|g(|q), observed band structure and systematics,        
#L values the same as the adopted ones
