#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility, and incident on a {+9}Be        
#  target. Fission fragments were separated and analyzed by BigRIPS       
#  separator, transported to focal plane of ZeroDegree spectrometer       
#  and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper. Particle identification  
#  was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method. Delayed gamma rays from microsecond
#  isomer were detected by three clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g,
#  isomer half-life. Details of the decay scheme are unknown
