#  2014Wa26: a high-spin isomer in {+126}Pd produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,F) 
#  reaction at 345 MeV/nucleon at RIBF-RIKEN facility. Residual nuclei of 
#  interest were separated and identified using BigRIPS and ZeroDegree    
#  spectrometer. A total of 53,000 {+126}Pd fragments were implanted in   
#  a highly segmented active stopper WAS3ABi consisting of eight double-  
#  sided silicon-strip detectors (DSSSDs). These detectors were used for  
#  detecting |b particles as well as conversion electrons form highly-    
#  converted transitions in {126}Pd. The gamma rays were detected using   
#  EURICA array with 12 Cluster-type HPGe detectors with a timing         
#  window of 100 |ms relative to the trigger signal from a plastic        
#  scintillator placed at the end of the beam line. Measured E|g, I|g,    
#  (particle)|g(delayed) coincidence. Deduced levels in {+126}Pd and      
#  {+126}Ag, J, |p, half-lives of isomer and ground state of {+126}Pd.    
#  2014Wa26 discuss in detail the small energy difference of 297 keV      
#  between the (10+) and (7-) isomers as compared to similar levels       
#  in heavier N=80 isotones, and the role of configuration mixing         
#G E(X)$2013Wa24 state that 542 and 788 |g rays seem to appear in         
#G |b|g-coin spectrum detected within 100 ms after the implantation of    
#G {+126}Rh ions, suggesting that the 2023, (5-) and 2110, (7-) isomers   
#G may be populated in |b decay of {+126}Rh                               
#G RI$Relative to 100 for 842.6|g in {+126}Ag from the decay of {+126}Pd  
#G ground state
