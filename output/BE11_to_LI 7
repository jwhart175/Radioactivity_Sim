#  1971Al07: {+11}Be |b-decay activity was produced in the                
#  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be reaction by bombarding 50 |mg/cm{+2} targets with   
#  3.0-MeV tritons. Ge(Li) and NaI(Tl) detectors and Si detectors were    
#  used to measure |g-rays and |a-particles. Eight |g-ray transitions and 
#  T{-1/2}=13.6 s {I6} were measured. In general, the decay intensities   
#  to {+11}B levels are deduced by balancing the observed |g-ray          
#  transitions and |g-decay branching ratios (BRs) with the observed rate 
#  of |b-rays. The strongest {+11}B transition is the 2125-keV |g ray from
#  the first excited state to the ground state, which is directly fed and 
#  fed from higher-lying states.                                          
#  The delayed |a-particle spectrum was also measured. The interpretation 
#  of this spectrum was complicated because the produced {+11}Be activity 
#  was implanted into the target, and the observed energy                 
#  depended on implantation depth, {+11}B parent level, emission angle    
#  etc.. Analysis of the spectrum appeared most consistent with emission  
#  from {+11}B*(9870). Two other potential |a-emitting states at          
#  {+11}B*(10250,10380) were unfavored.                                   
#  The delayed |a BR of 3.0% {I7} from {+11}B*(9870) to {+7}Li{-g.s.} was 
#  deduced, based on an analysis that found an intensity of 33% {I3} for  
#  the 2125-keV |g ray. Observed delayed |a-particles were not found in   
#  coincidence with 478-keV |g-rays from the first excited state of       
#  {+7}Li, but |a-particle emission to the {+7}Li*(478) level             
#  could not be excluded because the relatively thick targets could       
#  absorb the alphas before they reached the detector.                    
#  An upper limit of |< 5% feeding to the excited state was suggested.    
#  1981Al03: {+11}Be |b-delayed particle decays were measured using the   
#  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be at E{-t}=3.4 MeV. The study was focused on          
#  measuring the |b-delayed |a-particle branch. Thin {+9}Be foils         
#  contained in a Helium-jet system permitted the capture of produced     
#  activity in the He cell; the activity was then deposited on a counting 
#  tape. The activity was transported to a counting area where Si and     
#  NaI(Tl) detectors were used to measure delayed particles and |g-rays.  
#  |a particles and corresponding {+7}Li recoils ions were observed       
#  both in singles and in coincidence with 478 keV |g-rays.               
#  The |a-particle energy spectrum was unambiguously assigned to decay    
#  from  {+11}B*(9870). The charged-particle spectrum observed            
#  in coincidence with E{-|g}=485 keV {I10} provided evidence that some   
#  small branching takes place from {+11}B*(9875) to the first            
#  excited {+7}Li*(478) state; the BR for this decay is 12.6% {I12}. It is
#  then concluded that the BR of {+11}B*(9875) to {+7}Li{-g.s.} is 87.4%  
#  {I12}. Compared with the well known E{-|g}=2125 keV intensity (I=0.33  
#  {I3}) and various cascades observed in the {+11}Be(|b{+-}) decay       
#  scheme, the BR of 2.9% {I4} to {+11}B*(9875) was deduced.              
#  1982Mi08: {+11}Be |b-decay |g-ray activities were studied in the       
#  {+9}Be(t,p){+11}Be reaction by bombarding a {+9}Be foil with 3.0-MeV   
#  tritons. Ge(Li) and NaI(Tl) detectors and Pilot-B scintillation crystal
#  were used to measure singles |g-ray, |g-|g coincidence and |b spectra  
#  and |b-|g coincidences, respectively.                                  
#  The intensity of 2125-keV |g-decay of 0.370 {I25} was deduced.         
#  Authors adopted the value of 0.355 {I18}, which is the average         
#  of their value and the previous value of 0.33 {I3} (1971Al07).         
#  Comments: By normalizing the I{-|a}/I{-2125|g} of (1981Al03) to the    
#  2125-keV |g-decay intensity=0.355 {I18} from (1982Mi08) a more precise 
#  value of the |b-delayed |a-decay intensity, I{-|a}=0.031 {I4}, was     
#  obtained. In (1981Al02) {+11}B*(9875) was found to decay with BR of    
#  87.4% {I12} and 12.6% {I12} to {+7}Li*(0,478), respectively.
