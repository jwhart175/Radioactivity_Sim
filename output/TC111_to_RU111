#  The experiment was performed using on-line mass separation             
#  of products of proton-induced fission of uranium                       
#  at the IGISOL facility in Jyvaskyla. The mass separated                
#  beam was collected on a tape. Long-lived activities                    
#  were removed at regular intervals. The collection                      
#  point was viewed by a |DE-E plastic telescope for the detection        
#  of |b-particles and two Ge-detectors. The |b-|g and                    
#  |g-|g coincidence events were recorded. Since {+111}Tc has             
#  Q(|b{+-})={ 7.48 MeV {I8}}, the highest value of the separated         
#  A=111 isobars, |g rays were assigned to its decay by gating            
#  on the high-energy part of the |b-spectrum.                            
#  Preliminary data on 111TC B- decay were given by 1992PEZX and 1988PE13.
