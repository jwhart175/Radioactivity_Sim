#Radioactivity Sim Decay Chain Input File
#Data:
#STRING1 = Initial Nucleus (no spaces)
#STRING2 = Ending Nucleus  (no spaces)
#STRING3 = alpha, beta-, beta+, or gamma (no spaces)
#DOUBLE1 = EndNucleus to StartNucleus energy difference in MEV (no commas, no carats, greater than 0)
#DOUBLE2 = halflife in seconds (no commas, no carats, greater than 0)(note
#DOUBLE3 = probability (no commas, no carats, between 0 and 1)
#Rule Format:
#Rules are separated by lines, each line must have the following format:
#STRING1 STRING2 STRING3 DOUBLE1 DOUBLE2 DOUBLE3
#If a given rule has coincident radiation like gamma or x-rays then those are added with:
#+G STRING4 DOUBLE4 DOUBLE5
#where STRING4 is the photon name
#      DOUBLE4 is the photon energy in MeV
#      DOUBLE5 is the photon percent intensity
#It is useful to track these in order to get a complete radiation picture
#Each beta emission energy for the rule should be tracked with:
#+B STRING5 DOUBLE6 DOUBLE7
#where STRING5 is the beta name
#      DOUBLE6 is the beta energy in MeV
#      DOUBLE7 is the beta percent intensity
#Each alpha emission energy for the rule should be tracked with:
#+A STRING8 DOUBLE9 DOUBLE10
#where STRING8 is the alpha name
#      DOUBLE9 is the alpha energy in MeV
#      DOUBLE10 is the alpha percent intensity
#Each neutron emission energy for the rule should be tracked with:
#+N STRING11 DOUBLE12 DOUBLE13
#where STRING11 is the neutron name
#      DOUBLE12 is the neutron energy in MeV
#      DOUBLE13 is the neutron percent intensity
#It is useful to track these in order to get a complete radiation picture
