#Radioactivity Sim Decay Chain Input File
#Data:
#STRING1 = Initial Nucleus (no spaces)
#STRING2 = Ending Nucleus  (no spaces)
#STRING3 = alpha, beta-, beta+, or gamma (no spaces)
#DOUBLE1 = energy in MEV (no commas, no carats, greater than 0)
#DOUBLE2 = halflife in seconds (no commas, no carats, greater than 0)
#DOUBLE3 = probability (no commas, no carats, between 0 and 1)
#Rule Format:
#Rules are separated by lines, each line must have the following format:
#STRING1 STRING2 STRING3 DOUBLE1 DOUBLE2 DOUBLE3
