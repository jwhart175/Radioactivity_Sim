# Radioactivity_Sim 

Radioactivity_Sim is an experimental program with the goal of predicting the occurrance of all radioactive decay events (and the subsequent events precipated by those events) which cascade from the existance of a user-defined sample of source nuclei.

Radioactivity_Sim is experimental software that is in development.  At any time the developer may rewrite substantial portions of the code and those rewrites may be released with errors.  Furthermore, the program has not been thoroughly tested for accuraccy and agreement with experimentally measured values.  Therefore users are advised not to rely on the output of this program for any calculation that matters. 

This readme will be updated when the developer deems the program to be suitable to enter testing stages, with a statement to that effect.
