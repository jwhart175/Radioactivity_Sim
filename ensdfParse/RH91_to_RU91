#  91RH SOURCE produced in the {+58}Ni({+36}Ar{+10+},p2n) reaction;       
#  E=235 MeV beam degraded to AP 121 MEV near target center using a set of
#  TA degraders of varying thicknesses in the beam line in order to       
#  capitalize on the maximum cross-section of 11 |mb for this reaction    
#  channel as calculated by ^HIVAP code.  Nuclei recoiling out of the     
#  target were stopped and neutralized by 500 mbar of purified Ar gas     
#  inside a cell.  Reaction products were ionized selectively, according  
#  to Z, using two dye lasers tuned to the resonant atomic transitions    
#  of RH or RU, thereby enhancing strongly the ionization and subsequent  
#  extraction of those nuclei and improving the statistical quality of    
#  |g spectra resulting from their decay. The laser-ionized nuclei were   
#  guided toward the ^LISOL mass separator by a sextupole ion guide.      
#  Measured EG, IG, GG COIN, |b|g (coin), I(|e+|b), isotope ^T{-1/2} with 
#  two HPGe detectors arranged in a compact configuration around          
#  |b-sensitive plastic |DE detectors that enclosed a tape station.

#E TI        2004DE40 calculated |b-feeding to 91RH GS and excited states 
#E using the 511 keV annihilation line. Since all I(511G) that could      
#E not be associated with |g events visible in the |g-ray spectra were    
#E attributed to GS |b feeding, branching to weakly populated states and  
#E to LEVELS emitting |g-rays outside the 4 MeV |g-energy range may have  
#E been wrongly included in the GS branch, resulting in an underestimate  
#E of branching to some excited states.                                   
#E LOGFT     Values should probably be regarded as lower limits; the large
#E Q VALUE suggests the possibility of significant unobserved feeding     
#E to highly excited states whose deexcitation may reduce the intensity   
#E imbalance at lower-lying levels; the possible presence of G-RAYS       
#E with EG outside the 4-MEV experimental energy window further increases 
#E the uncertainty in deduced intensity imbalances.  See ALSO THE COMMENT 
#E ON TI. LOGFT VALUES ASSUME AN UNCERTAINTY OF 400 IN Q FROM SYSTEMATICS.
