#  {+109}Xe was produced and identified in {+54}Fe({+58}Ni,3n) reaction   
#  at E({+58}Ni)=220,225 MeV in a fusion-evaporation reaction, followed   
#  by mass separation of A=109 products were using Recoil Mass            
#  Spectrometer at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam facility.           
#  The fragments were separated according to the ratio of atomic mass     
#  and ionic charge. The separated ion beam passed through the mylar      
#  film of a microchannel plate counter and then implanted into           
#  (at an energy of |?60 MeV) into a double-sided silicon strip detector  
#  (DSSD). Sequence of |a-|a decay events with a certain time selection   
#  with the implanted events were recorded, from which {+109}Xe was       
#  unambiguously identified. Measured isotopic half-life, E|a, I|a.
