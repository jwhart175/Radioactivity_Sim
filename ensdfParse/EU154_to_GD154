#G           THE INDICATED PLACEMENTS OF THE G'S IN THE LEVEL SCHEME      
#G  ARE SUPPORTED BY THE GG-COINCIDENCE RELATIONS FROM 2004Ku13, AS WELL

#G RI        The RI values for the prominent G rays are important because 
#G 154EU is used as an efficiency calibration standard for Ge detectors.  
#G For this reason, some of these RI values were given detailed           
#G consideration by the Decay Data Evaluation Project, a program carried  
#G out under the auspices of the ^IAEA. The 154EU data were evaluated by  
#G ^V.P. Chechev and ^N.K. Kuzmenko and included all the data available   
#G to them. Their results are given in 2004BeZQ. The data reported by     
#G 2004Ku13 were not included in their work, but are in generally good    
#G agreement with it.                                                     
#G RI        Values of the absolute emission probabilities of the         
#G  154EU-decay |g's have also recently been measured by 2004Te01. These  
#G  values are in generally in good agreement with the evaluated values   
#G  of Chechev and Kuzmenko, as well as with those of 2004Ku13.           
#G E         VALUES ARE FROM 2004Ku13, UNLESS NOTED OTHERWISE.
