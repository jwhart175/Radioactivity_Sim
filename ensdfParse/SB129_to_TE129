#  1970Oh05: source from {+130}Te(|g,p). Measured E|g, I|g, |b; |g|g-

#B whereas none is expected. In the opinion of the evaluators, this       
#B apparent feeding is due to poor knowledge of the intensity of 180.42|g;
#B note that I|g=2.389 in 1989WaZJ is much lower which gives a

#L and using the uncertainties as quoted in 1989WaZJ, reduced |h{+2}=64   
#L and 53 E|g values fall outside 3|s. Using 0.05 minimum uncertainty
