#  First identification of {+277}Mt nuclide from |a decay of {+281}Rg. The
#  {+281}Rg isotope was formed in |a-decay chain:                         
#  {+293}117 --> {+289}115 --> {+285}113 --> {+281}Rg; {+281}Rg           
#  mainly decays by SF mode, but 2013Og04 discovered its |a decay mode    
#  also, which populates {+277}Mt.                                        
#  The {+293}117 isotope was produced in reaction: {+249}Bk({+48}Ca,4n),  
#  E=252,256,260 MeV; rotating target.                                    
#  {+249}Bk radioactive target was produced in neutron irradiation of     
#  Cm and Am targets in high flux isotope reactor at ORNL. The chemically 
#  purified target contained 22.2 mg of {+249}Bk and only 1.7 ng of       
#  {+252}Cf, with no other detectable impurities. Targets of              
#  0.31 mg/cm{+2} thickness deposited onto Ti foils were prepared at      
#  RIAR, Russia; and mounted on a disk that was rotated at 1700 rpm       
#  perpendicular to the beam direction.                                   
#  Facility: U-400 cyclotron with the Dubna gas-filled recoil separator   
#  (DGFRS) of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions,                 
#  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (JINR)                   
#  Evaporation residues passing through the separator  registered by      
#  time-of-flight system, implanted in 4x12cm Si-detector array. Energy   
#  resolution (FWHM) for |a particles implanted in focal plane 60-140 KeV,
#  side detectors 160-230 KeV. Measured E|a, half-lives, |a|a correlations
