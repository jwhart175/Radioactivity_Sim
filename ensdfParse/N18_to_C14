#  1989Zh04: A thick Ta target was bombarded by a 35 MeV/A {+22}Ne beam   
#  to produce {+18}N ions that were selected by the Reaction Products Mass
#  Separator (RPMS). The {+18}N ions were implanted into a telescope      
#  comprised of five Si detectors that was situated in the focal plane    
#  of the RPMS. An implantation period of 1.2 s was used for collecting   
#  activity; this was followed by a 1.3 s counting period. The |b-decay   
#  products were detected with essentially 100% efficiency. The apparatus 
#  was calibrated using |b-delayed |a-particle emissions groups from      
#  {+11}Be and {+8}Li nuclei.                                             
#  Two strong groups are observed in the |a-particle spectrum, resulting  
#  from decays of the {+18}O*(7616,8038) states with J|p=1{+-}{-3} and    
#  1{+-}{-4}, respectively.  A broad peak near 3 MeV (E{-x}=9 MeV, |G{-|a}
#  |? 500 keV) is also observed but the origin was unclear. 1987Aj02      
#  suggests there may be 6 unresolved |a-particle emitting groups in this 
#  region. The |b-decay branching ratios to {+18}O*(7616,8038) are found  
#  as 6.8% {I5} and 1.8% {I2} assuming |G{-|a}/|G=1.0 for these states.   
#  The branching ratio |> 3.6% {I2} was deduced for the broad structure.  
#  A total |b-delayed |a-decay branching ratio of (12.2 {I6})% is deduced.
#  1993Bu21, 2007Bu01: A thick target was bombarded by a 500 MeV proton   
#  beam to produce {+18}N ions that were selected by the TISOL separator. 
#  The resulting {+18}N{+16}O molecular beam was implanted in a 10        
#  |mg/cm{+2} carbon foil. After a 1.0 s collection time, the             
#  catcher foil was rotated to a position between two Si surface barrier  
#  detectors. About a hundred times the yield of 1989Zh04 was obtained.   
#  T{-1/2}=620 ms {I8} was measured for the activity, which is consistent 
#  with the {+18}N lifetime.                                              
#  The observed |a-spectrum was calibrated at the E{-|a}=1.081 and 1.409  
#  MeV peaks (from {+18}O*(7616,8038)) and analyzed with the R-matrix     
#  approach. The full range of the |a-particle spectrum was roughly double
#  that of 1989Zh04 and additional |a-groups were observed at higher      
#  energies. In the analysis the branching ratios are normalized          
#  to 12.2% from 1989Zh04 (6.8% {I5}, 1.8% {I2} and 3.6% {I2}).           
#  Comments:                                                              
#  The work of 2007Bu01 resolves the |a-spectrum at E{-|a}=1.5-5.5 MeV    
#  into seven states that show a distinct interference pattern. Treatment 
#  in the E{-|a} |? 2.2 MeV region is different; 1989Zh04 assume a        
#  multi-component group while 2007Bu01 assume a single broad state as    
#  indicated by 1993Re03.                                                 
#  The R-matrix analysis of the superior data set in 2007Bu01 is          
#  preferred, but the normalization of branching ratios in 2007Bu01 to    
#  12.2% from 1989Zh04 is surprising, since 2007Bu01 observed many groups 
#  that had not been observed in 1989Zh04. By chance both analyses have   
#  deduced the same branching ratio for the strongest E{-|a}=1.081 MeV    
#  group; this normalization is accepted and the analysis in 2007Bu01 is  
#  adopted with the total |b-delayed |a-decay branching ratio of          
#  (12.2 {I14})%.
