#  2003Di06 (also 2003DiZW): Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g coin, half-life
#  using four large HPGe detectors and |DE-E |b telescopes. {+130}Cd      
#  isotope produced by 1 GeV proton beam impinging on a Ta or W rod       
#  in close proximity to the UC{-x}-C target. Fast neutrons               
#  induce fission while the proton-rich isobaric spallation products      
#  are suppressed. A resonance-ionization laser ion source                
#  used to achieve chemical sensitivity for elements of                   
#  of high ionization potentials. The data for gamma-ray energies,        
#  intensities and |b feedings were obtained from 2003DiZW (priv. comm.   
#  from authors of 2003Di06, November 27, 2003)                           
#  2000Ka48 (also 2004KaZR): {+130}Cd isotope tentatively identified      
#  in {+238}U(p,F) reaction E=1 GeV, followed by separation with a        
#  chemically selective LASER ion source. Measured |g rays.               
#B IB,LOGFT$ From 2003DiZW. The total |b feedings                         
#B add to |?84% which does not include 3.6% from neutron emission; however
#B about 12% feeding still remains unaccounted (evaluator's note)         
#B IB(A)$From |g-ray intensity only; does not include possible            
#B contribution due to emission of delayed neutrons from the              
#B neutron-unbound level                                                  
#G ${+130}Cd decays by |b{+-}n also with %|b{+-}n=3.6 {I10}; a |g ray at  
#G 315.3 {I4} (I|g=3.3 {I6} relative to 100 for 1669.2|g) has been        
#G assigned to {+130}Cd |b{+-}n decay to {+129}In                         
#G $ A 1395-keV tentative |g ray reported by 2000Ka48 has not been        
#G confirmed in the work of 2003Di06, thus it is omitted here.            
#G E,RI$From 2003DiZW. The authors mention                                
#G that they have indication for two additional gamma rays above 5 MeV,   
#G but these are considered as tentative since these were seen only       
#G in one of three detectors
