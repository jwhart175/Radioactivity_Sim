#B           E(|b{+-}) are from 1966Ha26. Other: 1963Gu04.                
#B           I(|b{+-}) are from |g intensity balances, with I|b{+-}(125)  
#B set to 0; 1966Ha26 give similar values. Calculation gives 6% {I2}      
#B feeding to the 125 level, but, for 0+ to 2-, one expects (1973Ra10)    
#B LOGF1T |>8.5 or I|b{+-}|<0.1%.

#G following this decay (1966Ha26) and the {+153}Eu(3n,|g) reaction.      
#G M         Normalization of the CE spectrum and the G-ray spectrum to   
#G  deduce conversion coefficients for the G transitions was done using   
#G  the theoretical value, KC=0.062, for the 165.8, E1 G. The EKC value   
#G  for this G was measured relative to that of the 123, E2 G in 154EU    
#G  decay, for which the theoretical value, KC=0.65, was used (1966Ha26). 
#G M(X)      Value from the 153EU(3N,G) reaction. It is included to help  
#G  obtain an intensity balance in the level scheme.                      
#G CC        Computed from the more precise E|g values in the
