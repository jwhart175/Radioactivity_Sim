#  159SM produced by thermal-neutron fission of 235U (1986Ma12) and       
#   spontaneous fission of 252CF (1987Wi14). In both cases                
#   identification was by mass separation and the genetic relation        
#   to the 159EU daughter activity.                                       
#  The G data and decay scheme are from 1987Wi14.                         
#  Experimental methods:                                                  
#  1986Ma12: produced by thermal-neutron fission of 235U with mass        
#   separation in TRISTAN; report half-life and 2 G's (114, 190).         
#  1987Gr12: same as 1987Wi14; report half-life.                          
#  1987Wi14: produced by spontaneous fission of 252CF with mass           
#   separation; report half-life and 16 G's and all in scheme.            
#   Deduce IB- and some multipolarities and mixing ratios.                
#  1990An31: repeat half-life from 1987Wi14.                              
#B           With a Q value of 3805 keV and levels reported only to       
#B  1052 keV, the scheme is not complete. The computed log{Ift}           
#B  values may be lower than might otherwise be expected. The effect      
#B  of higher-energy levels would be to reduce these IB- values and       
#B  increase the log{Ift} values.                                         
#B IB        From G intensity balances. Value for ground-state branch     
#B      is assumed to be equal to that to the 75 level. Since the scheme  
#B      is incomplete, no uncertainties are given.                        
#G MR(S)     Authors argue that the M1 component is "asymptotically       
#G      unhindered and intrinsically quite strong", so the transition     
#G      is predominantly M1 (1987Wi14).                                   
#L E         From least-squares fit to G energies.                        
#L J         From 159EU Adopted Levels and based on the (t,|a)            
#L      assignments of 1979Bu05, except that for the 1052 level, which    
#L      is based on this decay. See the Adopted Levels for the band       
#L      assignments.
