#  2010Wi03 (also 2009Gr06, 2008WiZZ): {+83}Ga isotope produced in        
#  proton induced fission of {+238}U with E(p)=54 MeV.  Fission products  
#  passed through charge exchange cell, separated in the high-resolution  
#  injector magnet and re-accelerated to 225 MeV.  Identification based   
#  on time-of-flight and energy loss. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g and |b|g    
#  coincidences using four HPGe clover detectors and two plastic          
#  scintillator detectors.                                                
#  2006Pe20 (also 2007Ib01,2004Ve14,2004PeZW thesis,2003Pe18): {+83}Ga    
#  isotope produced by fast neutron fission of {+238}U. Fission products  
#  ionized and magnetically mass separated. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g and   
#  |b|g coincidences using two large volume HPGe detectors and a 4|p      
#  plastic scintillator.                                                  
#  Level scheme is that of 2010Wi03. 2006Pe20 report two |g rays          
#  belonging to the decay of {+83}Ga into {+83}Ge with energies of 867.4  
#  {I8} and 1238.2 {I5} keV. 2010Wi03 use |g|g coincidence data to show   
#  that the 867.4-keV |g-ray belongs to {+82}Ge, populated in the         
#  |b{+-}n decay of {+83}Ga.                                              
#  The decay scheme is very incomplete evidenced by the gap of nearly 10  
#  MeV between the highest energy level observed and the decay Q value.   
#  The total energy release of 2.3 MeV {I14} as calculated by the code    
#  RADLST is substantially smaller than the Q value of 11.7 MeV.

#G RI$From 2010Wi03, normalized to I|g(1348|g)=100. The 1348|g is
