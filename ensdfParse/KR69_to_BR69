#  2014De41: {+69}Kr isotope produced in the fragmentation of             
#  70 MeV/nucleon {+78}Kr beam with Be target at NSCL. Fragments          
#  selected with the A1900 separator and purified before being implanted  
#  onto double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) at the NSCL Beta       
#  Counting System (BCS) for |b and proton detection. BCS was surrounded  
#  by 16 Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA) for detection of prompt and |b  
#  delayed gamma with a photopeak efficiency of 7% at 1 MeV. Three PIN    
#  detectors were used to measure beam loss for particle identification.  
#  Measured E(p), E|g, |bp correlations, (|b-delayed proton)|g-coin,      
#  I(|e+|b{++}), T{-1/2}{+69}Kr                                           
#  2011Ro47: {+69}Kr isotope produced in the fragmentation of             
#  70 MeV/nucleon {+78}Kr beam with Ni target. Fragments selected with    
#  the LISE3 separator at GANIL and identified by time-of-flight and      
#  energy loss. Measured E(p), E|b, E|g, |bp correlations, {+69}Kr        
#  half-life using set of four Si detectors (an energy loss |DE detector, 
#  a degrade, DSSD and Si(Li)) for particles surrounded by four HPGe      
#  Clover detectors, three EXOGAM  and one mini-clover Ge detector for    
#  |g rays.                                                               
#  1997Xu01: |b-delayed proton decay of {+69}Kr. {+69}Kr produced by      
#  {+40}Ca({+32}S,3n) reaction using a E({+32}S)=170 MeV beam incident    
#  on a natural calcium target. Measured T{-1/2} and delayed proton       
#  emission by pulsed-beam technique and |DE-E telescope and Si(Au)       
#  surface barrier detectors
