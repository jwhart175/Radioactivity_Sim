#  2014Si18: {+136}Sn produced in fission of 345 MeV/nucleon {+238}U beam 
#  by {+9}Be target at RIDF-RIKEN facility. The fission fragments were    
#  identified by BigRIPS separator based on |DE-ToF-B|r method. The       
#  selected fragments of {+136}Sn were transported through ZeroDegree     
#  magnetic spectrometer and implanted in WAS3ABi detector array of       
#  Si-strip detectors for |b and ion detection. The |g rays were detected 
#  by an array of 12 large-volume Ge Cluster detectors of EUROBALL array. 
#  Measured delayed E|g, I|g, ({+136}Sn ions)|g-coin, |g|g-coin, isomer   
#  half-life. Comparison with shell-model calculations.
