#  DATA SET UPDATED (OCTOBER, 2010) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE NEW QP VALUE,  
#   REVISED ICC VALUES AND RECOMPUTED LOGFT VALUES.                       
#  Decay scheme is from 1975Ag03. This scheme goes up to 1318 keV and     
#       is very incomplete since there are many unplaced G's and the      
#       Total-Absorption G-Spectral (^TAGS) data of 1982By03 indicate     
#       that over 50% of the decays are to levels above 2 MeV. 1975St07   
#       propose a scheme up to 566 keV; below this energy this scheme     
#       agrees with that of 1975Ag03, except it lacks two levels. A       
#       long list of unplaced G's above 1400 keV is given by 1995AdZV     
#       and a set of more precise data on the G's below 502 keV is        
#       given by 1997AdZY.                                                
#  1970DeZF: produced by 162ER(P,4NG). Measured G singles with Ge         
#       detectors, ce singles with Si(Li) detector, and GG and ce-|g

#  1975St07: produced by spallation of Ta target with 660-MeV p with      
#       chemical and isotope separation. Measurements with Ge and         
#       Si(Li) detectors and magnetic spectrograph and spectrometer of    
#       G and ce singles, GG and GG(t) coincidences                       
#  1982By03: measured total-absorption G-spectra (^TAGS) with 3 NaI(Tl)   
#       G detectors and a Si(Li) B+ detector. Spectra measured with       
#       and without coincidences with B+. Measurement gives the           
#       |e+B+ feeding as function of the excitation energy.               
#  1983Be17: produced by Er(p,xn) with isotope separation. Measured       
#       ce-ce and ce-G coincidences in magnetic-lens spectrometer for     
#       ce and plastic scintillator for G.

#       1400 to 2864 keV.                                                 
#  1997AdZY: abstract listing EG and IG values for G's from               
#       38 to 501 keV.                                                    
#E E         Endpoint E{-B+}=2050 {I100} (1975St07) with Q=3.4 {I3}       
#E      MeV where the larger uncertainty on the Q value is from the       
#E      ambiguity of the lowest level with significant population.        
#E      Other Q(|e) values: 3850 {I100} (1991AlZY); 3670 {I100}           
#E      (1994Po26).                                                       
#E TI        These values are computed from the G intensity balances      
#E      at each level with the ground-state branch assumed to be          
#E      approximately equal to those to the 59- and 144-keV levels        
#E      and the sum of the feeding to the levels below 500 keV set to     
#E      AP 31% as reported by 1982By03 for a band of branches centered    
#E      at 300 keV. The total |e+B+ decay accounted for is, then, 34%.    
#E TI        The decays from the higher-lying levels via the unplaced     
#E      G's will change the |e+B+ feedings of these levels. These         
#E      values thus represent upper limits.                               
#E LOGFT     From the comment on the I(|e+B+) values, there is a large    
#E      uncertainty in these values.                                      
#G E,RI      From 1975Ag03, unless otherwise noted. Other: 1975St07.      
#G M         From 159ER Adopted Gammas. They are from 1975St07 and

#G E(B)      Assignment to decay of 159TM is uncertain (1975Ag03).        
#G      Transition is reported by 1975St07 with quite different           
#G      intensity.                                                        
#G E(C)      Assignment to decay of 159TM is uncertain (1975Ag03),        
#G      but transition is reported by 1975St07 with similar intensity.    
#G E(D)      From 1975St07.
