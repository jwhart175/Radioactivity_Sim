#  2008Os02: {+166}Eu identified and produced in {+238}U(p,F) reaction    
#  at E(p)=36 MeV. Target=600-800 mg/cm{+2} natural UC{-x} containing     
#  1 g/cm{+2} {+238}UC{-x}. Experiments carried at JAEA on-line isotope   
#  separator (JAEA-ISOL) and ISOL-based Tokai radioactive ion accelerator 
#  complex (TRIAC) using newly developed forced electron beam induced arc 
#  discharge (FEBIAD-|b{-2}) type ion source, and a surface ionization    
#  type ion source. Mass separation of the fission products was achieved  
#  by an integrated target-ion source system connected to the acceleration
#  chamber of the mass separator. The activities were deposited on a tape 
#  transport system. Measured E|g, |b|g-coin, |b(x ray)-coin, half-life   
#  The decay scheme is incomplete
