#  {+22}N beam was produced by fragmentation of a E=140 MeV/nucleon       
#  {+48}Ca primary beam on a Be target and separated by A1900 fragment    
#  separator at NSCL facility. The secondary beam containing {+22}N was   
#  implanted on a thin plastic implantation detector. Measured E|g, I|g,  
#  |b, |b|g coin, |b-delayed neutrons, |b(n) coin, and half-life using an 
#  array of sixteen neutron detectors and eight detectors from the        
#  Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA). Deduced level scheme of {+22}O.      
#L E$ From E|g's                                                          
#L E(A)$ Level decays by neutrons                                         
#L J$From comparison with shell model calculations (2010Su03), except
