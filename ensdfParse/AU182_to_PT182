#  In 182AU A DECAY, three branches are reported at 5283 5 (10),          
#  5352 5 (100), 5403 5 (29) (1995Bi01) with ALPHA branching of 0.13% 5   
#  1992DeZO: measured g factors of {+182}Au g.s.                          
#  All data are from 1999Da18, unless otherwise stated                    
#E TI$Apparent |e+|b{++} feedings deduced (by evaluators) from intensity  
#E balance at each level. Calculations of log| {Ift} values are not       
#E deduced due to possible missing |g rays in the large energy gap of     
#E about 6 MeV between the highest populated level and Q(|e)              
#E TI(X)$If J|p({+182}Au g.s.)=2+, then feeding to this level is not      
#E likely                                                                 
#G $In |g|g(|q) measurements, the second transition in all cases          
#G is 154.9|g from first 2+ state.                                        
#G E,RI$ From 1999Da18, unless otherwise stated. The |D(E|g) assigned as  
#G 0.2 keV based on e-mail reply from one of the authors (T. Kibedi)      
#G on June 10, 2003.

#G E(B)$Assignment uncertain since the line could be contaminated         
#G by |g ray of a similar energy in the decays of {+182}Pt and {+182}Hg   
#G E(D)$899.3|g and 1054.3|g may define a level at 1054 keV
