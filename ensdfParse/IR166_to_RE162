#  NEW DATA SET, PREPARED DECEMBER, 1997 BY CW REICH                      
#  All data are from 1997Da07, unless noted otherwise                     
#  166IR produced in the 92MO(78KR,p3n) reaction, with E(78KR)=384 MEV.   
#  Enriched (GT 97% 92MO) target of thickness 580 |mg/cm{+2},             
#  presumably evaporated onto a 700 |mg/cm{+2} ^Al backing. The recoil    
#  nuclei were separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio in the   
#  ^Fragment ^Mass ^Analyzer at the ^ATLAS accelerator facility. After    
#  passing through a thin position-sensitive parallel-grid avalanche      
#  counter, located at the focal plane of the analyzer, the recoils were  
#  implanted into a double-sided silicon-strip detector. Both position    
#  and time correlations between the recoils and their decay products     
#  were measured, as well as energies and intensities of their emitted    
#  radiations. Results include T1/2, EP, %p, EA, %|a.

#  1997Da07: 166IR produced in the 92MO(78KR,p3n) reaction, with

#  1996Pa01: 166IR produced as a fusion evaporation product in the        
#  112SN+58NI reaction, with E(58NI)=297 and 329 MEV. The 112SN target    
#  (enrichment not given) was AP 0.9 mg/cm{+2} thick. The recoil          
#  products were separated in flight in the ^Daresbury recoil mass        
#  spectrometer and implanted in a double-sided silicon-strip detector.   
#  This detector (energy resolution LE 20 keV FWHM) was used to study     
#  position and time correlations of the decay events. Measured           
#  energies and intensities of the emitted particles and nuclide T        
#  values.                                                                
#  For another study, see 1981Ho10. 166IR produced by 58NI bombardment.   
#  ALPHA spectrum of recoil nuclides was measured with a SI detector      
#  following velocity selection. 1981HoZM give the same data.
