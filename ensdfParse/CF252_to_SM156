#  DATA SET RE-DONE (AUGUST, 2011) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE DATA FROM       
#   2009Si21.                                                             
#   THE DATA ARE PRIMARILY FROM THE STUDY BY 2009Si21, WITH ADDITIONAL    
#   INFORMATION FROM 1995ZH15, 1997Do20, 1997Ha64, AND 1998Ga12. THE      
#   MIDDLE TWO OF THESE LISTED PAPERS HAVE MANY AUTHORS IN COMMON. IN     
#   ALL OF THESE STUDIES, 156SM IS ONLY ONE OF A NUMBER OF NUCLIDES       
#   THAT WERE INVESTIGATED.                                               
#  2009Si21: 156SM produced as a product of the SF of 252CF. Fission      
#   fragments were detected using the Gammasphere array of                
#   anti-Compton spectrometers at Argonne National Laboratory. Measured   
#   EG, RI, T1/2, GG coin in various combinations of prompt and           
#   delayed |g's. Report members of the GS band up through the 16+        
#   member and a rotational band up through the (15-) member built on     
#   the (5-) isomeric level. Comparison with the results of               
#   quasiparticle-rotor model calculations.

#   GG COINCIDENCES MEASURED USING TWO HIGH-RESOLUTION ^LEPS DETECTORS    
#   AND TWO LARGE-VOLUME Compton-suppressed Ge DETECTORS. REPORT EG AND   
#   THE GS BAND UP THROUGH THE 14+ MEMBER.

#   CONSISTING OF 48 PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS, EACH HAVING AN ACTIVE AREA OF    
#   3 CM2 AND A THICKNESS OF 500 MICRONS. |g's DETECTED USING THE         
#   ^EUROGAM ^II ARRAY, COMPOSED OF 54 Compton-suppressed Ge detectors:   
#   30 COAXIAL DETECTORS AT FORWARD AND BACKWARD ANGLES; AND 24           
#   "clover" DETECTORS AROUND 90 DEG. PROMPT AND DELAYED |g's             
#   (0 TO 1 US) FOLLOWING FISSION WERE DETECTED USING THE Ge DETECTORS    
#   OF ^EUROGAM ^II. MEASURED FRAGMENT-FRAGMENT-G AND                     
#   FRAGMENT-FRAGMENT-GGG COINCIDENCES. REPORT ONE ISOMERIC LEVEL WITH    
#   TWO DEEXCITING |g's AND THE GS BAND UP THROUGH THE 12+ MEMBER,        
#   TOGETHER WITH NUCLEAR-MODEL CALCULATIONS OF THE SPECTRUM OF

#  SOME EARLIER STUDIES (prior to 1974): 1970ChZH; 1970Jo20; 1970Wi16;    
#  1972Ho08. FOR A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS, SEE

#       with fission fragment detectors.  Lifetimes were measured from

#G  that RI(880)/RI(1148)=0.87.
