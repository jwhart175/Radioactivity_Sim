#  1974Wa14 (also 1971Wa09): sources produced by {+186}W(p,p|a) E=50, 92  
#  MeV. Measured E|g, I|g, E|b, |g|g, |b|g coin, isomer T{-1/2}.          
#  Other: 1983Zy02: {+182}Hf produced in ({+84}Kr,X) and ({+136}Xe,X) on  
#  natural tungsten target at 8.5 MeV/nucleon                             
#G M$The assumed multipolarities are consistent with the intensity        
#G balances at each level, with mult=E2 constrained for 97.8|g            
#G RI(A)$Another 97.8-keV transition was observed in {+182}Hf |b{+-}      
#G decay. The intensity has been divided by the authors assuming          
#G I(|g+ce)(97.9|g)=I(|g+ce)(244|g)
