#  2014Su11: {+64}V isotope produced at the NSCL-MSU facility             
#  by the fragmentation of a {+76}Ge beam, E=130 MeV/nucleon, impinging   
#  on {+9}Be target. Products were selected by the A1900 fragment         
#  separator and identified by time of flight and energy loss information,
#  then delivered to |b counting system (BCS) surrounded by SeGA Ge array 
#  for |g-ray detection. The {+64}V ions were finally stopped in 1 mm     
#  thick DSSD which detected |b particles. Measured E|g, ({+64}V)|g       
#  coincidence, |b|g correlated spectra. Deduced levels, half-life,       
#  an isomer in {+64}V                                                    
#  |g ray from first 4+ to first 2+ was not seen in this work; and        
#  no |g rays were observed which could be assigned to the beta-delayed   
#  neutron decay of {+64}V
