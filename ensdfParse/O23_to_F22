#  {+23}O beam was produced from a primary beam of {+48}Ca at 140         
#  MeV/nucleon on a {+9}Be target. The fragments were separated by        
#  A1900 fragment separator. The beam of {+23}O was used                  
#  in a pulsed mode of 300 ms timing. The detection system consisted      
#  of implantation detector (3 mm plastic scintillator), an array of 16   
#  neutron time-of-flight detectors and eight |g-ray detectors of         
#  segmented germanium array. {+23}O identification was achieved by       
#  time-of-flight and energy loss information in silicon detectors.       
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, (particle)|g coin, |b, |g|b coin, delayed     
#  neutrons, isotopic half-life by timing of |g rays, |b rays and delayed 
#  neutrons.
