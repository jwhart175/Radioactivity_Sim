#  The level scheme is considered (by the evaluator) as tentative         
#  1994TeZZ: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g(K| x ray) coin, E|a, T{-1/2}.    
#  Source from {+110}Pd({+58}Ni,4n) E=340 MeV followed by mass-separation.
#  1997Dr09: {+144}Sm({+24}Mg,xn) E=109-141 MeV. From excitation          
#  functions, two |g rays of 187.0 {I1} and 268.7 assigned to the decay   
#  of {+164}W. T{-1/2}=7.0 s {I2} from time decay of 187|g. But none of   
#  these |g rays is reported by 1994TeZZ. A 186.8|g is assigned by        
#  1994TeZZ to {+165}W decay with T{-1/2}=5.9 s {I3}                      
#  T{-1/2}=6.44 s {I17} (1994TeZZ)                                        
#  {+164}W decays by |a also (%|a=3.8 {I12})                              
#L $1994TeZZ propose J|p=(1+) for all the levels above 11.4,              
#L based on log| {Ift} values. But in the evaluator's opinion, the level  
#L scheme does not seem well established to calculate correct |e+|b+      
#L feedings.                                                              
#E $1994TeZZ give %|e+%|b+ feedings of 84 {I14}, 2.5 {I15}, 4.7 {I23} and 
#E 8.6 {I18} for levels 111, 443, 483 and 513, respectively, based on the 
#E present level scheme                                                   
#G E(A)$From 1997Dr09 only. I|g(187)/I|g(269)=5.7 {I19} (1997Dr09).
