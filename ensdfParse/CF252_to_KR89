#  2008Hw03: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin using Gammasphere array of 101  
#  HPGe detectors with Compton-suppression. The |g rays from Kr isotopes  
#  were identified by gating on transitions in the fission partner Sm     
#  isotopes.

#G $ All |g rays from levels above 28.6 keV were observed in coin         
#G with fission partner Sm isotopes. The 11/2- --> 9/2+ -->5/2+           
#G cascade in {+89}Kr is similar to the one observed in {+91}Sr.          
#L E$ From E|g data, assuming uncertainty of 0.3 keV for each |g ray      
#L J$ As proposed by 2008Hw03 based on comparison with a similar          
#L |g|g cascade in {+91}Sr and (790.0|g)(953.9|g)(|q). The assignments    
#L in Adopted Levels are given under parentheses.
