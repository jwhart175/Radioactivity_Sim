#  Isomer in {+108}Nb discovered in {+9}Be({+238}U,X) reaction            
#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility incident on {+9}Be target.       
#  Fission fragments were separated and analyzed by BigRIPS separator,    
#  transported to focal plane of ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally      
#  implanted in an aluminum stopper. Particle identification was          
#  achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method. Delayed gamma rays from microsecond    
#  isomers were detected by three clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured    
#  E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer half-life. Deduced levels
