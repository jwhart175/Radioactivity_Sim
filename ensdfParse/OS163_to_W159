#  DATA SET UPDATED (MARCH, 2010) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE JPI VALUE FOR    
#   THE 163OS GROUND STATE, MODIFIED QP VALUE AND SOME CHANGES IN THE     
#   COMMENTS.                                                             
#  1996Pa01: {+163}Os produced and identified by recoil-mass separation   
#     of fragments from heavy-ion fusion reactions. Selected ions         
#     were implanted in Si detectors; measured T1/2 and EA.               
#  1996Bi07: {+163}Os produced in {+92}Mo({+78}Kr,xn) followed by         
#     separation of recoil nuclei by a Fragment Mass Analyzer.            
#  1981Ho10 (also 1981HoZM): {+163}Os identified from a study of          
#     neutron-deficient |a emitters produced by bombarding Mo-Sn          
#     targets with a {+58}Ni beam and V-Ni targets with a {+107}Ag beam,  
#     and by comparison of parent energy to daughter energy.
