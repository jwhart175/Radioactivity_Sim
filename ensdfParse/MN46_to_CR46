#  2007Do17: {+46}Mn produced in fragmentation of {+58}Ni{+26+} beam at   
#  74.5 MeV/nucleon with natural Ni target at SISSE/LISE3 facility in     
#  GANIL. Fragment separator=ALPHA-LISE3. Fragment                        
#  identification by energy loss, residual energy and time-of-flight      
#  measurements using two micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors and Si      
#  detectors. Double-sided silicon-strip detectors (DSSSD) and a thick    
#  Si(Li) detector were used to detect implanted events, charged          
#  particles and |b particles. The |g rays were detected by four Ge       
#  detectors. Coincidences measured between charged particles and |g rays.
#  T{-1/2} measured by time correlation of implantation events due to     
#  {+46}Mn and subsequent emission of protons and |g rays.                
#  2007Do17 and 2001Go01 are from the same group. Some of the results     
#  in 2007Do17 are an improved analysis of experiments reported           
#  in 2001Gi01                                                            
#  2001Gi01 (also 2001Gi02): Ni({+58}Ni,X) E=74.5 MeV/nucleon. Fragments  
#  selected by the ALPHA-LISE3 fragment separator with a Be degrader and  
#  Wien filter at GANIL. Ions implanted in a Si-detector telescope which  
#  measured |DE, E, and position. With tof measurements, started both by  
#  the cyclotrons' high-frequency and a micro-channel plate detector      
#  before the Wien filter, implanted ions could be identified. The        
#  telescope was surrounded by Ge detectors to measure |g's in the        
#  radioactive decay.                                                     
#  1992Bo37: delayed-proton energies from the 9236-keV level in {+46}Cr   
#  measured with E-|DE detector.                                          
#  All data are from 2007Do17, unless otherwise stated                    
#G E(A)$ Unplaced |g is in either {+46}Cr from |e decay or                
#G in {+45}V from |ep decay. An unplaced 739.7|g probably belongs         
#G in the latter decay mode since it is seen in coin with a 475.2|g       
#G in {+45}V
