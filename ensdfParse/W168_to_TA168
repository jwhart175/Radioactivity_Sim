#  The decay scheme and all data are from 1990Me12.                       
#  NO MULTIPOLARITIES ARE KNOWN BUT, PROVIDED %EC+B+ TO 179 LEVEL IS >2,  
#  LOGFT<5.9 AND THE TRANSITION IS ALLOWED; GIVEN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF
#  THE 178G, THIS CONDITION IS SATISFIED AND JPI=1+ CAN BE ASSIGNED       
#  TO THE 178 LEVEL.  PROVIDED %EC+B+ TO THE 352 LEVEL IS >1.4, THIS      
#  BRANCH WILL BE ALLOWED ALSO; THIS CONDITION IS SATISFIED EVEN IF THE   
#  TWO DEEXCITING GAMMAS HAVE NEGLIGIBLE CONVERSION, PROVIDED NONE OF     
#  THE UNPLACED TRANSITIONS FEEDS THE 352 LEVEL.  THIS MAY NOT BE A VALID 
#  ASSUMPTION, SO THE ASSIGNMENT OF 1+ TO THIS LEVEL IS HIGHLY TENTATIVE.
