#  1974Al11: A target BeO (94% {+10}Be) was bombarded with 31-MeV {+6}Li  
#  ions; a fast beam chopper was used to establish beam activation and    
#  decay counting periods. A plastic scintillator detector measured the   
#  beta emissions while a NaI(TI) detector measured coincident decay      
#  gamma-rays.                                                            
#  Activities from numerous reaction products were detected in the        
#  target, however by applying a beta particle energy threshold cut to    
#  the beta-gamma coincidence data it was possible to select {+14}C       
#  gamma-rays that followed the decay of {+14}B.                          
#  The |b-decay is primarily to {+14}C*(6.09) [J|p=1-] and (6.73) [J|p=3-]
#  states, though only an upper limit could be placed on a branch to the  
#  (7.34) [J|p=2-] state. The half-life, T{-1/2}=16.1 ms {I12}, was       
#  deduced by analyzing the decay curve of the {+14}C*(6.09) state for    
#  events in coincidence with E{-|b} > 6.3 MeV.                           
#  The experimental results are gamma-ray intensities. The measured |g-ray
#  intensity ratios are                                                   
#  {II}{-6.09}/{II}{-6.73}/{II}{-7.34}=100/(10.0+-2.0)/< 2.2; using these 
#  observed intensities and the level decay branching ratios from         
#  1970Aj01, the relative beta feedings to the {+14}C*(6.09,6.73,7.34)    
#  states was deduced.                                                    
#  In order to place the relative intensities on an absolute scale the    
#  authors estimated the unobserved feeding to the ground state as        
#  (5 {I3})%, and they made a further assumption that the %beta-n=0.      
#  With these assumptions, which account for (5 {I3})% of the decay, the  
#  beta decay branching ratios were deduced by combining the              
#  measured |g-ray intensity ratios with the know level gamma-ray decay   
#  branching ratios. The absolute beta-branching ratios                   
#  I|b{-6.09}/I|b{-6.73}/I|b{-7.34}=(81 {I9})%/(8.6 {I+17-40})%/< 11% were
#  deduced by normalizing to 100%. There are no new measurements on these 
#  relative values, however subsequent experiments have produced measured 
#  values for the beta feeding to the ground state and to neutron unbound 
#  states.                                                                
#  1993ReZX: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
#  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
#  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
#  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
#  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderated {+3}He
#  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
#  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
#  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
#  detected in the zero-threshold counter.                                
#  An associated conference report indicates the |b-delayed neutron       
#  probability P{-n}=(6.1 {I3})% and T{-1/2} = 12.4 ms {I3} (the          
#  International conference on nuclear data for science and technology:   
#  nuclear data for the twenty-first century, Gatlinburg, TN (United      
#  States), 9-13 May 1994).                                               
#  Results presented in (1993ReZX) analyzed the data measured in the      
#  polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter and deduced a general value for  
#  the energy of neutrons emitted from the decay; E{-n}=1.38 MeV          
#  {I+86-65}. The value E{-n}=1.3 MeV {I3} is published in the 1994       
#  conference report.

#  plastic stopper. Beta-rays were detected in a |DE-E scintallator       
#  telescope while gamma-rays were detected in a NaI detector. A          
#  high-energy component with E{-|b} > 14.6 MeV was observed and found    
#  in anti-coincidence with gamma-rays. This branch is attributed to      
#  beta feeding directly to the {+14}C ground state; I|b{-g.s.} =         
#  (1.4 {I8})%.

#  Comments:                                                              
#  Absolute beta branching ratios have been measured for feeding to       
#  the {+14}C ground state and for feeding to neutron unbound states.     
#  Therefore, the relative gamma-ray intensity values of (1974Al11)       
#  are reevaluated with the current level gamma decay branching           
#  ratios, and the deduced intensities are normalzed with the decay       
#  feeding the {+14}C ground state and the %|b-n.                         
#  In the analysis of the uncertainties of the I|b branching ratios the   
#  I|b{-7.34} is treated as I|b{-max}/2 +- I|b{-max}/2, and the           
#  uncertainty mainly impacts the I|b{-6.09} branch.
