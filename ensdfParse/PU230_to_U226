#  2002CaZZ: measured E|a, I|a, T{-1/2}, |a fine structure                
#  By using the Geiger-Nuttall relationship between |a energy             
#  and its partial half-life, systematic studies for |a-decaying          
#  isotones were performed by 1993Po14, 1991Po21, 1987Po06 and 1985Po25;  
#  the partial half-life of the |a decay to g.s. was calculated as        
#  5.2 min (1993Po14), 3.25 min (1991Po21), 5.8 min (1987Po06) and 1.6 min
#  (1985Po25).
