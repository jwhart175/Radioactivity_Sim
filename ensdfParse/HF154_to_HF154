#  Produced in the 102PD(54FE,2n) reaction with 240-245 MeV 54FE ions on  
#  a 1-MG/CM2 102PD target. The reaction products were separated using    
#  the ^Daresbury ^Recoil ^Mass ^Separator. The source material was       
#  collected on an ^Al catcher foil. GAMMA radiation was studied using a  
#  ^LEPS and four large ^Ge detectors. The time relationships between the 
#  signals from a position-sensitive detector and the G-ray detectors     
#  were used for mass, T and GG coincidence determinations.               
#G E         The existence and energies of the G-rays were established    
#G on the basis of peaks having only a few (typically 4-6) counts in the  
#G spectra. These presumably represent only the dominant decay path of    
#G the isomer.                                                            
#L E         The ordering of the G's, and thus the level energies, is     
#L based on the systematics of the lighter doubly even nuclides,          
#L especially 150ER and 152YB.                                            
#L J         Based on the systematics of the level schemes of the         
#L lighter-mass ^N=82 nuclides 148DY, 150ER, and 154YB.
