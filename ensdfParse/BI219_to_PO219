#  2014Mo02: {+219}Bi produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,X),E=1 GeV reaction,     
#  {+238}U beam provided by the UNILAC-SIS accelerator facilities at      
#  GSI with an intensity of 1.5|*10{+9} ions/spill (a repetition of 3 s   
#  and an extraction time of 1 s). The reaction products were separated   
#  and identified in the magnetic spectrometer Fragment Separator (FRS).  
#  Separation of {+219}Bi nuclei is based on B|r-|DE-B|r scheme.          
#  At the focal plane, the recoils were slowed down in an Al degrader     
#  and implanted in a composite DSSSD detector system comprising of 3     
#  layers, each with 3 DSSSD pads with 16x16 pixels, and dimensions of    
#  5x5 cm{+2} and 1 mm thick.  The DSSSD detectors were surrounded by     
#  the RISING |g-ray spectrometer comprised of 105 HPGe crystals          
#  arranged clusters of seven elements. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin,     
#  |b-|g-t coin in coincidence with implanted recoils.                    
#  No decay scheme could be constructed from the observed 12 |g rays      
#  and several |g|g-coincidence relationships
