#  2004Sc42: {+130}In isomer produced in thermal neutron induced fission  
#  of {+241}Pu followed by separation of fission fragments by LOHENGRIN   
#  mass separator. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g with two Ge detectors: one     
#  Clover detector and one triple cryostat on the Miniball array.  The    
#  fission fragments were detected in a |DE-E gas detector to achieve     
#  good mass resolution.
