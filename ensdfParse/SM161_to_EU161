#  1998Ic02: {+161}Sm produced as a product of the proton-induced fission 
#  of {+238}U. The fission products were identified using on-line isotope 
#  separation coupled to a gas-jet transport system. Isotopic             
#  identification was established through observation of Eu K x rays      
#  in |b-gated x- and |g-ray spectra of the A=177 mass fraction (which    
#  contained singly-ionized monoxide ions containing {+161}Sm). |b{+-}    
#  radiation was studied using plastic scintillators. |g and x rays       
#  were studied using Ge detectors. Measured E{-|g}, |b|g,                
#  |b{+-}x coincidences, |g(t), x(t), and T{-1/2}.                        
#  2007Ha57: MEASURED Q- FROM TOTAL-ABSORPTION G SPECTROSCOPY USING A     
#   ^BGO DETECTOR. MANY OF THE SAME AUTHORS AS IN 1998Ic02 WERE INVOLVED  
#   AND MANY DETAILS IN THE SOURCE PRODUCTION AND HANDLING ARE SIMILAR    
#   IN THE TWO STUDIES.
