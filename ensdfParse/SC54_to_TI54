#  2010Cr02: {+54}Sc isotope produced in Be({+76}Ge{+30+},X)              
#  fragmentation reaction at E=130 MeV/nucleon, A1900 fragment separator. 
#  Time-of-flight technique. Fully stripped secondary fragments were sent 
#  to NSCL Beta Counting System (BCS). System of three Si PIN detectors,  
#  a double-sided silicon strip detector and six single sided silicon     
#  strip detectors. Detected |g rays using 16 Ge detectors of the         
#  Segmented Germanium array. Measured half-life of {+54}Sc by            
#  fitting the decay curves to a single exponential function              
#  with a constant background.                                            
#  2004Li75: {+54}Sc isotope produced in {+9}Be({+86}Kr{+34+},X)          
#  fragmentation reaction at E=140 MeV/nucleon, A1900 fragment separator. 
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g, |b|g(t), lifetime using a double-sided  
#  Si microstrip detector (DSSD) and the MSU segmented Germanium Array    
#  (SeGA).  Identity of particle from energy loss and time of flight from 
#  a PIN detector, the NSCL |b calorimeter, and scintillator.  The SeGA   
#  array was arranged around the |b counting system and comprised six Ge  
#  detectors. See also 2002Ja16.

#  In the decay scheme of 2010Cr02, IB sums to 84 {I9}, missing IB        
#  is suggestive of a neutron-branching contribution of 16 {I9}.
