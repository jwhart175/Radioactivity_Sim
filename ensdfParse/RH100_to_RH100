#G           There are two main G rays reported in the decay of this      
#G isomer: one at 32.6 and the other at 74.9. The third G ray at 42.1 is  
#G reported by 1982MaZP and possibly by 1984Ma30 but 1978Ki07 report not  
#G observing such a transition. A 264.7 G ray reported by 1974Si18 has    
#G not been seen in any later work (1978Ki07,1980Ba59,1986Du04), thus     
#G omitted here. Information concerning relative G-ray intensities is only
#G partially available. 1978Ki07, however, pointed out that the 32.6G     
#G and 74.9G have comparable G-intensities. Coincidence data and          
#G CE data are not available to confirm the complete level scheme.

#L           The level scheme presented here is as suggested by 1982MaZP  
#L $ The decay scheme does not seem well established in the absence of    
#L supporting coincidence data and CE data. The 32.6G-74.9G cascade seems 
#L to be correct based on intensity balance, thus defining the energy of  
#L the isomer at 107.6. Using CC(th)=10.3 for 32.6G (see 100PD EC decay)  
#L the intensity balance gives mult=M2 for 74.9G as suggested by 1980Ba59.
#L This gives JPI=4+ for the isomer which is in conflict with the         
#L systematics of even-^A RH isotopes and the absence of transition       
#L to GS (JPI=1-). Based on the observation of 42.1G (also supported      
#L by the in-beam spectrum of 1984Ma30) 1982MaZP suggested that both the  
#L 74.9G and 32.6G are doublets, deexciting the known 74.9 level          
#L and the 107.6 isomer. This scheme is consistent with mult=E3           
#L for a part of the 74.9G and JPI=5+ for the isomer, but remains to      
#L be confirmed through coincidence and conversion electron data
