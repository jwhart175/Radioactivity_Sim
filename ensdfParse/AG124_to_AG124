#  2013La11: E=750 MeV/nucleon {+136}Xe and {+238}U beams from GSI, SIS-18
#  synchrotron. Targets: 1 and 4 g/cm{+2} Be. Detectors: FRS, ionization  
#  chambers, multiwire chambers, scintillation detectors, RISING          
#  multidetector array comprising 105 HPGe detectors, mounted in 15       
#  composite Cluster detectors without anti-Compton shields. Measured:    
#  tof, |DE, B|r, E|g, I|g, |g(t), |g|g, |g|g(t), half-lives.             
#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility. Fission fragments were separated
#  and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal plane of       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper.  
#  Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method.            
#  Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were detected by three     
#  clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer       
#  half-life. Deduced levels                                              
#  2007To23, 2006ToZW, 2005WaZY: fragmentation of a 120 MeV/nucleon       
#  {+136}Xe beam; MSU Beta Counting System; measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, 
#  half-life of the isomer in 2005WaZY
