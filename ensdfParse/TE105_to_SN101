#  2006Li41: {+105}Te produced in |a decay chain of {+109}Xe.             
#  {+109}Xe was produced and identified in {+54}Fe({+58}Ni,3n) reaction   
#  at E({+58}Ni)=220,225 MeV in a fusion-evaporation reaction, followed   
#  by mass separation of A=109 products were using Recoil Mass            
#  Spectrometer at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam facility.           
#  The fragments were separated according to the ratio of atomic mass     
#  and ionic charge. The separated ion beam passed through the mylar      
#  film of a microchannel plate counter and then implanted into           
#  (at an energy of |?60 MeV) into a double-sided silicon strip detector  
#  (DSSD). Sequence of |a-|a decay events with a certain time selection   
#  with the implanted events were recorded, from which {+109}Xe was       
#  unambiguously identified. Measured isotopic half-life, E|a, I|a.       
#  2006Se08: {+105}Te isotope produced and identified in                  
#  {+50}Cr({+58}Ni,3n) reaction at E=2224, 214 and 204 MeV. The reaction  
#  products were separated from the beam according to mass/charge ratio in
#  the Fragment Mass Analyzer (FMA) at Argonne. The recoils were implanted
#  in a double-sided Si strip detector (DSSD). Measured |a decay          
#  spectrum and isotopic half-life. A total of 13 counts were observed in 
#  the |a spectrum from A=105 just above 4500 keV. The corresponding      
#  cross section is |? 10 nb for beam energies of 204 and 214 MeV. No     
#  events were seen for beam energy of 224 MeV.
