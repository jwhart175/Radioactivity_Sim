#E TI        Values are from G-transition intensity balances at each      
#E      level and are somewhat uncertain due to the incompleteness of     
#E      the decay scheme. Values are taken to be 0 for the 0 and 97       
#E      levels, since these are 2{+nd} forbidden decays. Values of <1%    
#E      for levels below 1 MeV are considered very uncertain and have     
#E      been omitted.                                                     
#E IB,IE     The I|e and IB+ values are computed from the I(|e+B+)        
#E      and the theoretical ratios from the LOGFT code.                   
#G E         From 1979Ad08, unless noted as from 1977Bo26 or 1995AdZW;    
#G      significant differences between 1979Ad08 and 1977Bo26 values      
#G      are noted. Uncertainties in 1977Bo26 are AP 0.3 keV from a        
#G      general statement; these uncertainties have not been included     
#G      here.                                                             
#G RI        From 1977Bo26, unless noted as from 1979Ad08 or 1995AdZW.    
#G      Significant differences between 1979Ad08 and 1977Bo26 are noted.  
#G      Uncertainties in 1977Bo26 are 10% to 30% from a general comment   
#G      and are assigned by the evaluator as 30% for IG < 10, 20% for 10  
#G      LE IG < 100, and 10% for IG GE 100.

#G      |a{-K}(exp) and |a{-L}(exp) data of 1977Bo26 and 1979Ad08.        
#G      Values were normalized for an E3 assignment for the 205.9 G.
