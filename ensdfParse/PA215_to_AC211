#  2000He17: {+215}Pa activity was produced by {+170}Er({+51}V,6n),       
#  E=214-286 MeV, separated from the beam using a velocity filter, and    
#  implanted into a 16-strip semiconductor detector. The activity was     
#  identified by |a-spectroscopy and |a-|g spectroscopy. Measured E|a,    
#  T{-1/2}=14 ms 2.                                                       
#  1996An21: {+215}Pa activity was produced by {+170}Er({+51}V,6n),       
#  E=28-87 MeV, separated from the beam using a velocity filter           
#  SHIP, and implanted into a 16-strip position-sensitive semiconductor   
#  detector. The activity was identified by |a-correlations  and |a-|g    
#  coincidences. Measured E|a, T{-1/2}=15 ms 4.                           
#  1979Sc09: {+215}Pa activity was produced by {+181}Ta({+40}Ar,6n),      
#  E=165-202 MeV, separated from the beam using the velocity filter       
#  SHIP, and detected by a |DE-E counter telescope consisting of a        
#  secondary electron detector and a silicon surface barrier detector.    
#  The activity was identified by 10 |a-correlated events. Measured E|a;  
#  T{-1/2}=14 ms {I+20-3} was indirectly estimated from experimental data.
#  This result was not included in weighted average due to low statistics.
#  E|a following semiempirical procedure of 1961Ta22.                     
#  1997Mi03: {+215}Pa activity was produced by {+185}W({+35}Cl,2n),       
#  E=182.5 MeV, separated with the JAERI recoil mass separator and        
#  implanted on a double-sided position-sensitive silicon detector.       
#  |a-correlations measurement but poor statistics did not allow for a    
#  unique assignment of decay chain for {+214,215}Pa nuclides.            
#  The HF value is not given since r{-0} parameter for {+211}Ac           
#  cannot be deduced from interpolation of r{-0} for neighboring nuclides
