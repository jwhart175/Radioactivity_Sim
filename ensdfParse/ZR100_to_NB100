#  2007RI01: Isotopically separated 30-keV beam of {+100}Zr produced      
#  in U(p,F) reaction at E(p)=30 MeV using ion-guide isotope separator    
#  on-line (IGISOL) facility at JYFL. The fission fragments were          
#  accelerated to 30 keV and mass separated by a 55|' dipole magnet.      
#  The separated beam was injected into a gas-filled radio frequency      
#  quadrupole cooler and buncher (RFQ).                                   
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g coin, |x|g coin using a planar           
#  plastic scintillator for |b particles, a large Ge detector and a       
#  planar low-energy Ge detector for x rays and low-energy |g rays.       
#  Atomic mass measurements of {+100}Zr and {+100}Nb were made with a     
#  Penning-trap method using JYFLTRAP. The photon intensities and         
#  uncertainties on gamma-ray energies and intensities were supplied

#G RI$ From 2007RiZZ. Corresponding values from 1982VoZP are in general

#G $ The following G rays of energy (intensity) assigned to               
#G the decay of 100ZR by 1977Pf01 have been omitted due to lack of        
#G confirmation in the works of 1982VoZP and 2007RI01: 336.0(0.6),

#G RI$Photon intensities per 100 decays of 100ZR (2007RI01,1982VoZP). The

#G deduce the normalization factor. The 100ZR and 100NB isotopes were
