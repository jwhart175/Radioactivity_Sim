#  and A DECAY                                                            
#  The partial decay scheme is that proposed by 1978RI04 with             
#  the following changes: 1) the 3/2- state is the ground state and       
#  not at 19.58 KEV as proposed by 1978RI04; and 2) the 5/2- state is at  
#  0+x KEV (x LE 9.3 KEV) and not the g.s. All level energies of 1978RI04 
#  are therefore raised by x KEV. These changes are indicated by the      
#  results of 1983TH03 (J(GS)=3/2-) and 1962JU05, 1957AN53                
#  (E(5/2- level) LE 9.3). For tentative GG-coin results see table 6      
#  of 1978RI04.                                                           
#  THE DECAY SCHEME OF 199BI TO 199PB IS QUITE INCOMPLETE DUE TO A LARGE  
#  NUMBER OF UNPLACED TRANSITIONS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WITH UNCERTAIN       
#  PLACEMENTS                                                             
#G $I(G+-)=18.1 9 (relative to I(841G)=100) corresponds to %B+ AP 1.0     
#G RI$The 199BI source was produced by 1978RI04 in (P,XN)                 
#G reactions on natural lead followed by mass and radio-chemical          
#G separation. 1978RI04 assumed that all the G's are from the 9/2- 199BI  
#G GS EC decay; however, it is expected that some of the G rays           
#G are from EC decay of the 25-min 1/2+ isomer of 199BI. Some of the G's  
#G deexciting levels of 199PB fed directly from the EC decay of the 1/2+  
#G isomer may populate the 3/2- GS of 199PB rather than the 5/2-          
#G first excited state.                                                   
#G M$Based on EKC of 1978RI04 (425.3 M4 transition was used for           
#G normalization). The experimental precision did not allow a meaningful  
#G extraction of MR.                                                      
#G E(A)$1978RI04 list two G's in coin with 926.4G and five G's in coin    
#G with 945.96G; only the 391.28G is in coin with both of the             
#G above G's. This result may be inconsistent with the decay scheme.      
#G E(B)$1978RI04 list seven G's possibly in coin with the 1034.0G;        
#G none of these G's is the same as the three G's in coin with the        
#G 1052.8G, and the coin with the 720.3G is inconsistent with the         
#G decay scheme proposed by 1978RI04.                                     
#G E(C)$Listed as 1086.79 in figure 7 of 1978RI04                         
#G M(D)$The multipolarities of the 294.0G, 533.1G and 560.1G lead         
#G to contradictory PI assignments for the 1804 level according to        
#G the proposed level scheme.                                             
#G RI(E)$The uncertainty could be greater than 20% because of the
