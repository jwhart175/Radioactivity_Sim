#  2010Wi03 (also 2009Gr06, 2008WiZS): {+84}Ga isotope produced in        
#  proton induced fission of {+238}U with E(p)=54 MeV.  Fission products  
#  passed through charge exchange cell, separated in the high-resolution  
#  injector magnet and re-accelerated to 225 MeV.  Identification based   
#  on time-of-flight and energy loss. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g and |b|g    
#  coincidences using four HPGe clover detectors and two plastic          
#  scintillator detectors.                                                
#  2009Le26 (also 2009Ve11): {+84}Ga isotope produced in photofission of  
#  UC{-x} target with a 50-MeV electron beam. Fission products ionized    
#  and magnetically mass separated. Measured E|g, I|g, |b|g coincidences  
#  using a coaxial HPGe detector, a small EXOGAM clover detector and a    
#  cylindrical plastic scintillator.                                      
#  2006Pe20 (also 2007Ib01,2004Ve14,2003Pe18): {+84}Ga isotope produced   
#  in fast neutron induced fission of {+238}U.  Fission products ionized  
#  and magnetically mass separated. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g and |b|g      
#  coincidences using two large volume HPGe detectors and a 4|p plastic   
#  scintillator.                                                          
#  2009Le26 suggest the presence of an isomer in {+84}Ga with half-life   
#  of <85 ms and J|p=(3-,4-). This isomer may also decay by delayed-      
#  neutron emission, but no details of such a decay are known.            
#  Level scheme is that of 2010Wi03. 2006Pe20 place a 867|g from a level  
#  at 867 keV.  Such a transition is not reported by 2009Pe20 or          
#  2010Wi03 in {+84}Ga |b{+-}n decay, and thus, the 867-keV level and |g  
#  ray are not adopted here. See also comments on {+83}Ga |b{+-} decay    
#  for additional discussion of the 867|g and 867-keV level.  2009Le26    
#  report the 1046|g as belonging to the |b{+-} decay of {+84}Ga into     
#  {+84}Ge and based on an intensity imbalance, suggest the presence of   
#  an isomer in {+84}Ga with half-life of <85 ms and J|p=(3-,4-).         
#  2010Wi03 observe the 1046|g in both their {+83}Ga and {+84}Ga decay    
#  data, supporting its placement as a transition in {+83}Ga.
