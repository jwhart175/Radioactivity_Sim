#G E         Association of these gammas with a specific nuclide          
#G is uncertain at present.                                               
#L E         It is unclear which levels in {+181}Au are fed by |a decay   
#L from the 454-keV (9/2-) isomer of {+185}Tl. Based on systematics of    
#L 9/2- isomer |a decays from heavier odd-A Tl isotopes, the strongest    
#L branch is expected to feed the lowest-energy 9/2- level in {+181}Au.   
#L The level fed by the 6010|a (35 keV {I6} below the latter level) could 
#L be the (3/2-) g.s. or an unobserved 5/2- level which forms the g.s. in 
#L neighboring odd-A Au isotopes.                                         
#L In this case, the 35+x level would be the (9/2-) state.
