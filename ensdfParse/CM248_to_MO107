#H TYP=FUL$AUT=Jean Blachot$CIT=NDS 109, 1383 (2008)$CUT=1-Mar-2008$      
#  2005Ur02: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|g(|q), |g|g(lin pol),            
#  conversion-electron coefficients using EUROGAM2 array with four        
#  additional low-energy photon (LEP) detectors                           
#  2006Pi14: {+107}Mo nuclei produced in thermal-neutron induced          
#  fission of {+241}Pu target. Lohengrin mass spectrometer used to        
#  separate fission fragments according to mass/charge ratio. Measured    
#  |g(ce) coincidences and lifetime for a 65.4 level.                     
#  Gamma cascades are mostly in agreement with those from 2004Hu02:       
#  but the spin-parity assignments including that of the ground state,    
#   and associated band assignments are all different                     
#  1991Ho16: 6.5E+4 fission/s. Argonne Notre Dame G facility              
#  10 Bi-germinate-suppressed Ge detectors, 2 LEPS, 1 array of 50 Bi-Ge   
#  scin used as a multiplicity filter.                                    
#  All data are from 2005Ur02 unless otherwise stated                     
#G M$From |g|g(|q), mult=Q corresponds to |DJ=2 and mult=D to |DJ=1       
#G transition. In some cases mult is also from conversion coefficients

#L E$ from least-squares fit to E|g's (by evaluator) |DE|g=0.1 keV for    
#L strong transitions and up to 0.5 keV for weak |g rays (authors' note). 
#L The evaluator has assigned uncertainties to |g-ray energies based on   
#L the following criterion: |DE|g=0.1 keV for I|g>20, 0.3 for I|g=10-20   
#L and 0.5 for I|g<10.  For |g rays quoted to the nearest keV, |DE|g=1    
#L keV has been assumed
