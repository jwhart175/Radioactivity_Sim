#  2006Pe16: {+52}K isotope produced in spallation reaction by bombarding 
#  a UC{-x} target by a 1.4 GeV proton beam produced by the CERN          
#  proton-synchroton booster (PSB). Spallation products analyzed using    
#  the high resolution separator (HRS). Measured E|g, |g|g, |b,           
#  |b|n coin, |b|n|g coin, |b|g coin, and |b|g|g coin. The |g rays were   
#  detected using two large Ge clusters from the MINIBALL array. Low      
#  energy neutrons detected using using six detectors each composed of    
#  a thick BC400 plastic scintillator. High energy neutrons were detected 
#  using 11 curved BC400 scintillating plastic bars from the TONNERRE     
#  array. The |b particles were detected using a cylindrical plastic      
#  scintillator.                                                          
#  1985Hu03: {+52}K was produced by the fragmentation of a U target with  
#  600-MeV proton beam, on-line mass separation, measured E|g and         
#  |g|g-coin with Ge(Li) detectors, |b|g coin with Ge(Li) and |b          
#  telescope (0.5 mm scintillator sheet), E(n) with NE110 plastic         
#  scintillator sheet.                                                    
#  1983La23: {+52}K was produced by the fragmentation of a Ir target      
#  with 10-GeV proton beam, mass separation, measured T1/2. NE 213        
#  liquid scintillator.
