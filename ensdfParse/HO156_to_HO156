#  2003KaZP: Source produced in p-induced spallation of ^W, followed by   
#   on-line separation. Probably an experimental set-up similar to that   
#   of 1999KaZV. Report T as well as properties of |g's emitted from the  
#   daughter nuclide, 156DY.                                              
#  1999KaZV: Source produced in p-induced spallation of ^W.               
#   Isotope-separated sources. Measured EG, RI, GG, CE, T.                
#  1976IwZZ: Source produced in the 160DY(P,5N) reaction, EP=52 MeV.      
#   Source material contained both the isomer and the 156HO g.s.          
#   |g's studied using a 40 cm{+3} GeLI detector. For the isomer,         
#   report T and two |g's deexciting the 2787 level.                      
#  2002KaZO: Report T for this isomer.                                    
#  Properties of this isomer are deduced primarily from the EC+B+ decay   
#   data. The existence of an ^IT-decay branch is inferred from the       
#   fact that |g's from the decay of the GS are observed (1999KaZV).      
#   However, it is not known just which 156HO levels are populated in     
#   the ^IT decay.
