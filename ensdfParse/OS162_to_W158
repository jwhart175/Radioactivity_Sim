#  {+106}Cd({+58}Ni,p4n) reaction at E=300 MeV. The reaction products     
#  were separated by the gas-filled recoil separator RITU at Jyvaskyla    
#  facility, and implanted into double-sided silicon strip detectors      
#  (DSSD) of the GREAT spectrometer.                                      
#  Measured |a, protons, |a and proton correlations with the implanted    
#  nuclei, (recoil)|a coin. The {+159}Re nuclide was identified through   
#  correlations with 6445 keV {I3} |a peak from 1.5 ms {I2} activity of   
#  {+158}W produced as daughter of proton decay of {+159}Re. Deduced      
#  half-life of {+159}Re isomer. The ground state is not yet identified.
