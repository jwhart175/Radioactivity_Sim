#  2013Ra17: {+61}Mn produced in induced fission of uranium at ISOLDE-CERN
#  facility. E(proton)=1.4 GeV beam impinged a UC{-x} target of thickness 
#  45 g/cm{+2}. Reaction products where ionized by RILIS and              
#  separated based on their A/Q ratio using a High-Resolution Separator.  
#  {+61}Mn obtained in the reaction was implanted on an aluminized mylar  
#  tape for the decay. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, half-life using      
#  three plastic |DE |b detectors and two MiniBall |g-detector clusters.  
#  Deduced levels, J, |p, |b feeding intensities, log| {Ift}. Comparison  
#  with {+59}Fe data, and with shell-model calculations.                  
#  1985Ru05: first identification of {+61}Mn from fragmentation of {+82}Se
#  beam at 11.5 MeV/nucleon on tungsten target using on-line mass         
#  separator. Measured E|g, I|g, |b|g-, |g|g-coin, and T{-1/2} by Ge(Li)  
#  and plastic scintillator. Three excited states at 207, 391 and 629 keV 
#  were proposed through the observation of five |g rays                  
#  1999Ha05: 1-GeV proton -induced spallation of uranium UC{-2} target    
#  at ISOLDE-CERN facility. The laser ionized Mn isotopes were extracted  
#  from the ion source and mass separated. Using tape systems measured    
#  |b-delayed neutron multiscaling, E|g and |g|g coincidence. |b-delayed  
#  neutron data were collected by multiscaling measurements using         
#  Mainz 4|p He neutron counter.                                          
#  All data are from 2013Ra17                                             
#  From RADLIST code, deduced total decay energy is 5962 keV {I841}       
#  as compared to Q(|b{+-})=7178 keV {I3}, which suggests that the decay  
#  scheme is not known well                                               
#G RI(A)$From |g|g-coin data; transition not seen in singles spectrum     
#L E$From least-squares fit to E|g values. Reduced                        
#L |h{+2}=2.1 is somewhat larger than critical |h{+2}=1.7                 
#L J$From Adopted Levels. Most of the assignments are based on shell-model
#L calculations using GXPF1A interaction corroborated                     
#L by |b feedings and associated log| {Ift} values, and also comparison   
#L with the decay scheme of {+59}Mn to {+59}Fe
