#  DATA SET UPGRADED (SEPTEMBER, 2007) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE BRICC       
#   ICC'S, REVISED COMMENTS, AND DIFFERENT ORDERING OF THE PM ISOMERS.    
#  Data are primarily from 1993GrZY, a private communication; any         
#       conflicts with most complete published sets of data, namely       
#       1971Da28 and 1974Ya07, are noted. Others:

#      and |b- endpoint, probably for mixture of isomers.                 
#  1971Da28: Produced by {+154}Sm(n,p) with enriched (99.5%) target       
#      and E(n)=14.8 MeV. Measured |g singles, |g|g and |g|b-

#      coincidences with NaI, Ge, and plastic scintillator detectors.     
#  1973Pr05: Produced by {+154}Sm(n,p) with enriched target and           
#      E(n)=14.8 MeV. Measured |g and |b- spectra with GM tube, NaI,

#       Level scheme only, no |g data included. See 1993GrZY.             
#  1993GrZY: Produced by {+252}Cf spontaneous fission with isotope        
#       separation. Measured |g singles and |g|g coincidences.            
#       Private communication.                                            
#  1995Gr19: Produced by {+252}Cf spontaneous fission with isotope        
#       separation. Measured I|b(0+82) with a 4|p|b|g system.             
#  1997Gr09: Produced by {+252}Cf spontaneous fission with isotope        
#       separation. Measured I|b- as a function excitation energy with    
#       a total absorption |g spectrometer.                               
#B           The I|b{+-} to the excited levels have been deduced          
#B      independently of the |g data from the total absorption |g         
#B      spectrometer, TAGS, data of 1997Gr09. The measured spectrum       
#B      represents approximately the |b- feeding intensity as a           
#B      function of the excitation energy. When necessary, new levels,    
#B      called "pseudolevels", and associated decay |g's are              
#B      included in the analysis.  Since the resolution of the TAGS       
#B      system is typically 50-100 keV, the intensity assigned to a       
#B      a pseudolevel may represent the |b{+-} feeding to a single        
#B      level or to a group of levels in that region.                     
#B IB        Values are from |g intensity balances, except those for      
#B      the 0- and 82-keV levels which are from measurements of 1995Gr19. 
#B      The quoted uncertainties do not include any contribution from     
#B      the possible placement of the unplaced |g's.                      
#B      The I|b- values from the TAGS data (1997Gr09) are generally       
#B      in excellent agreement with those from the intensity balances.    
#B      The TAGS value is given in a comment if it differs by more        
#B      than 10%. Since the decay scheme is not complete, values          
#B      below 0.2% are not given.                                         
#B IB        The pseudolevels and the associated I|b- from the TAGS       
#B      data analysis are 3300 keV, 0.36%; 3400, 0.45; 3500, 0.45; 3600,
