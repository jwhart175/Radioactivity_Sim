#  1996Pa01: produced as |a decay product of {+170}Ir, which was produced 
#  in the {+106}Cd({+70}Ge,3p3n) reaction with E({+70}Ge)=354 MeV. The    
#  reaction products were separated in flight using the Daresbury recoil  
#  mass separator and were implanted in a double-sided silicon-strip      
#  detector (energy resolution|<20 keV). Position and time                
#  correlations between the parent and daughter nuclides were             
#  determined. E|a and T{-1/2} were reported.                             
#  1992Me10: {+166}Re was produced in the {+141}Pr({+32}S,7n) reaction,   
#  with E({+32}S)=235 MeV. The beam energy was degraded using Ta foils to 
#  measure excitation functions from |?175 to |?204 MeV. The reaction     
#  products were collected using a He-jet system with a fast              
#  tape transport. The samples were counted using a 450-mm{+2}            
#  surface-barrier |a detector mounted between a |gX and a 70% |g         
#  detector. Reported t, E|a, E|g, I|g.                                   
#  1984Sc06: {+166}Re produced in the {+144}Sm({+27}Al,5n) reaction, with 
#  E({+27}Al) between 130 and 155 MeV. Recoil nuclei were collected and   
#  transported using a He-jet and a fast tape-transport system. |a's were 
#  studied with a 300 mm{+2}|*100 |mm-thick Si surface-barrier detector.  
#  Reported T{-1/2} and E|a.                                              
#  1982De11: produced by {+63}Cu bombardment of enriched targets of       
#  {+107}Ag, {+109}Ag, {+108}Cd, {+110}Cd, {+113}In, {+112}Sn and         
#  {+116}Sn. Beam energy was degraded using Ni foils to a range from 245  
#  to 300 MeV. The reaction products were transported using a He-jet,     
#  fast-transport system. |a's were measured using a Si surface-barrier   
#  detector. Measured E|a.                                                
#  1978Sc26: {+166}Re produced in the {+93}Nb({+84}Kr,|a7n) and           
#  {+89}Y({+84}Kr,7n) reactions, with E({+84}Kr)=5.6 MeV/u and            
#  E({+86}Kr)=7.03 MeV/u. The beam energies were reduced using Ti         
#  degrader foils. The reaction products were transported using a He-jet  
#  transport system. The activities were counted using three Si           
#  surface-barrier detectors, one in a multiscaling mode. Reported        
#  T{-1/2} and E|a.                                                       
#  1984Sc06 suggest that the assignment of an |a activity having E|a=5495 
#  10 to {+166}Re by 1978Sc26 is incorrect, reporting instead E|a=5372    
#  {I10}. This calls into question the assignment of the |a activity to   
#  {+166}Re as reported by 1982De11, since 1984Sc06 suggest that they may 
#  have based their assignment on that of 1978Sc26. However, subsequent   
#  studies, especially 1996Pa01, have shown that the E|a value to be      
#  associated with the {+166}Re decay is not as low as 5372 keV but is    
#  greater than 5500 keV, thus invalidating the assignment by 1984Sc06.   
#  Note also, however, that 1996Pa01 report that E|a=5518 {I5} for the    
#  {+165}Re decay. Thus, |a energy alone is not sufficient to provide a   
#  unique mass assignment from the earlier studies; and the T{-1/2}       
#  values for {+166}Re and {+165}Re are quite similar. The possibility    
#  thus exists that the T{-1/2} and E|a values from these earlier studies 
#  (1978Sc26,1982De11) may have been affected by the presence of {+165}Re 
#  in the samples. Here, however, we have included the data from these    
#  studies as reported.
