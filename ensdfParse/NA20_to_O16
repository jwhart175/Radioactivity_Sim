#  1989CL02: ^The BETA+ DELAYED ALPHA PARTICLES FROM 20NA WERE MEASURED   
#  IN A STUDY OF THE BETA-Nu-ALPHA TRIPLE-CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS FOR    
#  20NA(JPI=2+,ISPIN=1) DECAY TO UNBOUND JPI=2+ STATES IN 20NE. THE 20NA  
#  NUCLEI WERE PRODUCED VIA THE 12C(10B,2N)20NA REACTION IN THE ^Chalk    
#  ^River ^FEBIAD ION SOURCE. A 40 ^KV BEAM WAS EXTRACTED AND IMPLANTED   
#  INTO A 30 UG/CM2 CARBON FOIL. ALPHA-PARTICLES WERE DETECTED            
#  IN 100 MICRON SI SURFACE BARRIER DETECTORS, WHILE BETA-PARTICLES WERE  
#  DETECTED IN A DELTA E-E DETECTOR. SINGLES AND COINCIDENCE DATA WERE    
#  COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. THE BETA+ AND GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA WERE MEASURED  
#  SEPARATELY IN A CONFIGURATION WITH THE DELTA E-E DETECTOR AND A        
#  GE(LI) DETECTOR.
