#  The tentative decay scheme and all data are from 1992Me10.             
#  THE largest EC+B+ IMBALANCE OCCURS AT THE 6+ 1042 LEVEL, BUT           
#  SIGNIFICANT IMBALANCE OCCURS AT 4+ AND 8+ STATES AS WELL, AND          
#  IMPLIED LOGFT VALUES TO PI=(-) LEVELS ARE LOWER THAN EXPECTED FOR      
#  FIRST-FORBIDDEN TRANSITIONS.  IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE 168RE PARENT  
#  HAS TWO ISOMERIC STATES WITH SIMILAR HALF-LIFE, RESULTING IN MIXED     
#  PARENTAGE FOR THE REPORTED DECAY, BUT THERE IS NO SUPPORTING EVIDENCE  
#  FOR THIS AT PRESENT.  GIVEN THE LARGE Q VALUE FOR THIS DECAY,          
#  IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT THE PRESENT DECAY SCHEME IS INCOMPLETE;         
#  1992ME10 REPORT NO EG VALUES ABOVE 1568 KEV for any nuclide in         
#  their experiment, so there may exist HIGHER ENERGY TRANSITIONS THAT    
#  WERE UNDETECTED IN THATR STUDY.  FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL INFORMATION      
#  CONCERNING THIS DECAY IS NEEDED.
