#  2008Ma01: {+53}Ca produced in fragmentation of E=140 MeV/nucleon       
#  {+76}Ge beam provided by the NSCL-MSU facility.                        
#  Isotopes separated with A1900 fragment separator.                      
#  Time-of-flight technique. Measured |b particles using Beta Counting    
#  System of three Si PIN detectors, a double-sided silicon strip detector
#  and six single sided silicon strip detectors. Detected |g rays using   
#  16 Ge detectors of the Segmented Germanium array. Measured half-life of
#  {+53}Ca by fitting the decay curves to a function which included       
#  decay of the parent, growth and decay of daughter and a constant       
#  background. No gamma rays were seen in correlation with |b rays.
