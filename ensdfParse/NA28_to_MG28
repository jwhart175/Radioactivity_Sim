#  14030 keV {I10} obtained from 28NA B- DECAY ^Q(g.s.) and branching.    
#  2012KU11: B- decay is studied in polarized 28NA isotope. It was        
#  produced from fragmentation of tantalum targets by 500 MeV protons at  
#  ^TRIUMF. Separated 28NA{++} beam, E=30.6 keV, was neutralized by       
#  colliding with the Na vapor and nuclear spin was polarized (|?50%)     
#  by collinear optical pumping. Polarized 28NA beam was ionized and      
#  transported with the polarization direction perpendicular to the beam  
#  direction. The spin orientation was flipped by changing the laser      
#  helicity in every 5 minutes. The beam was focused and stopped on a Pt  
#  foil. EG, RI, B-G and G-G coincidence measurements were performed      
#  using 9 HPGe detectors. A pair of plastic scintillators placed in front
#  of each HPGe detectors. Deduced level scheme, JPI.                     
#  1984GU19: 28NA was produced from fragmentation of iridium target by    
#  10 GeV protons from the ^CERN synchrotron, recoiled fragments were     
#  thermalized in graphite, ionized and mass-separated; a thin plastic    
#  scintillator, 2 Ge(Li) detectors, Measured: EG, B-GG COIN, RI.         
#  1979DE02,1974RO31: 28NA was produced from fragmentation of uranium     
#  target by 24 GeV protons from the ^CERN synchrotron, recoiled fragments
#  were thermalized in graphite, ionized and mass-separated; a thin       
#  plastic scintillator, 2 Ge(Li) detectors, Measured: EG, B-GG COIN,     
#  absolute RI.

#B IB$Deduced by the evaluator from G-ray intensity balance at each level 
#G E$From 2012Ku11, except otherwise noted. Some G-ray energies           
#G in 2012KU11 are discrepant compared to 1984Gu19 or other datasets. The 
#G source of the discrepancy is not clear.                                
#G RI$From 2012Ku11, except otherwise noted. G-ray intensities reported   
#G in 2012Ku11 and 1984Gu19 are mostly in agreement, except a few.
