#  DATA SET UPDATED (OCTOBER, 2009) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE NEW QP VALUE,  
#   CC VALUES FROM BRICC, MORE PRECISE EG VALUES FOR SOME G'S AND         
#   SOME INFORMATION PRESENTED IN UNPUBLISHED ABSTRACTS.                  
#  Decay scheme is primarily from 1972Ka37 and 1972Wo08 and levels are    
#  as proposed by both authors, except where noted otherwise. Other       
#  major ce studies are 1972Ha41 and 1979DzZZ. Others: 1965St08,          
#  1965Gr35, 1961Gr25, 1961Gr04, 1961Bj02, 1961Ab04, 1960Dn02, and

#  Since 2000, several abstracts, all from the same laboratory and        
#   describing further studies of the 161ER decay scheme, have appeared.  
#   However, they are generally not detailed and have as yet not been     
#   published. The evaluator has not incorporated most of this            
#   information into this data file.                                      
#  There are 39 |g's that are multiply placed and many levels that        
#  involve mostly |g's that are multiply placed. This limits the          
#  quantitative accuracy of many parameters of the level scheme.

#  2002AdZX (Conference Abstract): describes a study of the 161ER decay   
#   scheme using HPGE detectors and a mini-orange detector to measure     
#   |g radiation and conversion electrons. Report 265 |g rays in the      
#   161ER decay. Report new levels at 725.3, 989.7, 1035.9 and            
#   1477.4 keV and propose |g-vibrational (presumably of ^K-2 type)       
#   bandheads at 592.8, 958.1, and 1100.8 keV (based, respectively, on

#   5/2[402]) and a |b-vibrational bandhead based on 7/2[523] at          
#   1129.0. In the absence of most of the details regarding this

#   evaluation.                                                           
#  2007VaZX searched for three-quasiparticle states of the form           
#  (|n 3/2[521],|n 5/2[523],|p7/2[523]) in the region centered around     
#   1.5 MeV excited via allowed-unhindered (au) |b decay from {+161}Er    
#   through conversion-electron studies of the high-energy |g             
#   radiation from mass-separated {+161}Er sources. No evidence for such  
#   au transitions and, hence, for such excitations, was found in this    
#   study.                                                                
#  2008IbZZ (Conference Abstract): presumably a further analysis of the   
#   data of 2002AdZX by one of the authors of that study. Introduce new   
#   levels at 693.2, 859.6, 957.97 and 1603 keV. Do not confirm           
#   previously reported levels at 710, 1137 and 1325 keV, with the        
#   deexciting |g's placed elsewhere in the level scheme. In the absence  
#   of the details regarding these conclusions, the evaluator has not     
#   included this information in this data set, although the              
#   nonconfirmed levels have been shown here as questionable.
