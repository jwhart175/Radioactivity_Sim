#  several other references that are not present in ^NSR database.        
#  The decay scheme, which includes the |b{+-} decay to the               
#  ground state of {+40}Ca and two levels in {+40}Ar, is complete since   
#  these are the only levels in the daughter nuclides below the           
#  respective decay energies.                                             
#  In principle, the 1460-keV |g ray could be used for energy             
#  calibration. However, in a Ge semiconductor detector the               
#  apparent |g-ray energy depends on the source-detector                  
#  configuration and {+40}K sources usually consist of a large volume     
#  of material, so this E|g is usually not useful. This also means        
#  that in most cases the uncertainty in the observed energy is           
#  much larger than that given here.
