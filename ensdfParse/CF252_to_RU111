#  1998Hw02: a {+252}Cf source was sandwiched between two Ni foils and    
#  placed at the center of gammasphere with 72 Compton-suppressed Ge      
#  detectors                                                              
#  The identification of {+111}Ru is based on the known |g of the fission 
#  partners                                                               
#L E$From least-squares fit to E|g's (by evaluators), assuming |D(E|g)=0.3
