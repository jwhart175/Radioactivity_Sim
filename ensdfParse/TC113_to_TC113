#  2010Br15: {+238}U beam accelerated in the GSI LINAC to 11.4 MeV/nucleon
#  and then to 750 MeV/nucleon in the GSI SIS18 synchrotron, typical      
#  intensity of 10{+9} pps for a 1-s beam spill with a repetition period  
#  of 10-15 s. Target of 1.0 g/cm{+2} {+9}Be. Fully stripped fission      
#  fragments separated in the GSI FRagment Separator (FRS) and identified 
#  by means of time-of-flight and energy-loss techniques. Two             
#  scintillation detectors for time-of-flight, an eight-anode ionization  
#  chamber (MUSIC) for energy-loss and the RISING |g-ray array of 15      
#  cluster Ge detectors for detecting |g-rays. Measured E|g, I|g, T{-1/2} 
#  for an isomeric state.                                                 
#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility. Fission fragments were separated
#  and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal plane of       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper.  
#  Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method.            
#  Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were detected by three     
#  clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer       
#  half-life. Comparison with previous studies.                           
#G $In 2010Br15, no |g rays in coincidence with 114|g were seen
