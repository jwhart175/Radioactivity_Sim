#  {+36}Ar{+18+} primary beam with intensities between 4 |mA and 8 |mA    
#  provided by the coupled cyclotrons of GANIL. {+33}Ar{+3+} beam was

#  silicon cube detector (6 double-sided silicon strips-DSSSD) for        
#  detecting protons and |b particles and three high-efficiency for       
#  detecting |g-rays. Measured |s(E{-p}), E|g, I|g, p|g-coincidence.

#  reactions of 1 GeV protons with a CaO-target and subsequently          
#  separated at ISOLDE PSB Facility. {+33}Ar production rate: 1000 ions/s.
#  Detectors: a silicon |DE-E telescope, a gas-Si combination telescope,  
#  an annular Si for charged particles, a 70% germanium detector for      
#  |g-rays. Measured |b{++}p coincidence,|s(E{-p}),I{-p}. Deduced

#  the Berkeley 88-inch cyclotron. Detectors: a silicon |DE-E telescope   
#  for charged particles and a 2-in by 2-in NaI(Tl) crystal and a 45-cc   
#  Ge(Li) counter for |g-rays (FWHM=4 keV at E{-|g}=1 MeV). Measured p|g  
#  coincidence,|s(E{-p}),I{-p}. Measured T{-1/2} for{+33}Ar ground state.

#  The normalization of I|b in 1998En04 is wrong because a value of       
#  38.7% was mistakenly used for the I|b of the decay branch to the       
#  5544 keV level instead of the correct I|b value 30.7% from 1987Bo21.
