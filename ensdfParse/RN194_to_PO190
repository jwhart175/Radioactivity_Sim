#  First identification of {+194}Rn nuclide.                              
#  2006An36: {+194}Rn produced and identified in {+144}Sm({+52}Cr,2n)     
#  reaction at E=236 MeV; {+144}SmF{-3} rotating target onto a carbon     
#  backing. UNILAC heavy-ion facility at GSI, with SHIP velocity filter   
#  for separating evaporation residues.                                   
#  Detector system: Several different types of detectors were used:       
#  The decays of the evaporation residues were measured                   
#  by implanting residues in a thick 16-strip position-sensitive silicon  
#  detector (PSSD) with a typical FWHM |? 20 keV for |a particles         
#  in 6-8 MeV range. An array of six silicon detectors of similar shape   
#  (BOX detectors), mounted upstream of PSSD detector, was used to        
#  measure the energies of |a, |b and conversion electrons.               
#  Three thin time-of-flight detectors in front of the PSSD and BOX       
#  detectors permitted identification of reaction products from the       
#  scattered beam particles; and distinction between the decay events     
#  and implantation events through anti-coincidence technique.            
#  An additional thick Si detector was installed as a veto detector       
#  behind the PSSD detector in an anti-coincidence mode. This allowed     
#  distinction between the decays and the punch-through events (from      
#  high-energy protons and |a particles produced in the reactions         
#  on the carbon backing). For |g rays, a four-fold segmented 'Clover'    
#  Ge detector was used behind the PSSD detectors for prompt and delayed  
#  |g(residues) coin and/or |a|g coin measurements.                       
#  Identification of the isotope by time and position correlation of      
#  |a decays from {+194}Rn with the known |a decays from daughter         
#  isotope {+190}Po and grand-daughter {+186}Pb. Measured |a, |g, |a|g    
#  coin, |a(residues) coin, |g(residues) coin.
