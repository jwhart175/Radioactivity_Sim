#  2010El06: First identification of {+269}Sg nuclide in the |a-decay     
#  chain of {+285}114 nuclide produced in {+242}Pu({+48}Ca,5n) at         
#  E=256 MeV from LBNL cyclotron facility. Evaporation residues were      
#  separated by BGS based on magnetic rigidities. Signals from multiwire  
#  proportional counters (MWPC) and focal plane detector (FPD)            
#  were used to distinguish implantation events from radioactive decay    
#  events in the FPD. Z=114 events were identified by detecting time      
#  and position correlated events corresponding to their implantation     
#  and subsequent radioactive decay chain terminating in SF decay.        
#  The data of 1999Ni03 reporting |a-decay chain of {+293}118 leading     
#  to the final nuclide {+265}Rf, and cited in earlier Nuclear Data       
#  Sheets evaluation of 2000Fi12 have since been retracted (2002Ni10),    
#  and have not been confirmed in a repeated experiment at LBNL (2003Gr26)
