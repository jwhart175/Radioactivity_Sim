#  1969J021: ^A BEAM OF 3 MEV TRITONS IMPINGED ON A THICK 11B TARGET      
#  PRODUCING 13B NUCLEI VIA THE 11B(T,P) REACTION. THE TARGET WAS         
#  IRRADIATED FOR 3 MS, WHILE COUNTING LASTED FOR 12 MS. THE TARGET WAS   
#  SURROUNDED BY A 3 INCH BY 2 INCH BETA COUNTER SCINTILLATOR, A          
#  1 INCH THICK BY 8 INCH DIAMETER ^NE102 NEUTRON DETECTOR AND A          
#  5 INCH BY 5 INCH NAI GAMMA-RAY DETECTOR. NEUTRON ENERGIES WERE         
#  DETERMINED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT BETWEEN THE BETA AND NEUTRON DETECTORS.   
#  POPULATION OF RELATIVELY STRONG NEUTRON BRANCHES FROM 13C(7.5,8.86 MEV)
#  WERE OBSERVED.  SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER BRANCHES TO 13C(0,3.68 MEV)     
#  WERE DEDUCED FROM THE BETA- AND BETA-GAMMA SPECTRA                     
#  (92.1% AND 7.6%, RESPECTIVELY).                                        
#  1974AL12: ^The EXPERIMENTAL SETUP WAS SIMILAR TO 1969JO21, EXCEPT A    
#  LONGER NEUTRON FLIGHT PATH WAS USED AND HIGHER STATISTICS WERE         
#  OBTAINED. WEAKER BRANCHES FROM 13C(8.86,9.90 MEV) WERE OBSERVED, AND   
#  AN UPPER LIMIT ON DECAY FROM 13C(9.50 MEV) WAS ESTABLISHED.
