#  Penning-trap assisted |g-ray spectroscopy at JYFL facility             
#  Tc ions were produced in U(d,F) at 25 MeV beam energy at the IGISOL    
#  facility. Fission products were thermalized inside the gas cell, and   
#  guided through the sextupole ion guide (SPIG) and accelerated to       
#  30 keV. The ions were directed through a 55|' dipole magnet and        
#  injected into a gas-filled rf cooler buncher, and finally injected     
#  into the double Penning-trap JYFLTRAP. Measured cyclotron frequencies  
#  to determine Q value. For decay measurements, purified ions of {+114}Tc
#  were transported through the second Penning trap to the spectroscopy   
#  setup. Purified beam implanted into a movable tape surrounded a 2 mm   
#  thick plastic scintillation detector and three Ge detectors and a LOAX 
#  Ge detector for |b, |g, and x rays, E|g, I|g, |b|g and |g|g coin       
#  measurements. The yield of high-spin (|>4) isomer to the low-spin      
#  (1+) isomer is deduced by 2011Ri01 to be 0.27 {I6}
