#  Isomer with half-life of <500 ns discovered by                         
#  C.M. Folden III et al., Phys. Rev. C 79, 064318 (2009) through         
#  measurement of delayed |g rays in correlation with implanted           
#  {+78}Ga nuclei.                                                        
#  {+78}Ga produced through the {+9}Be({+238}U,X) reaction. {+238}U beam  
#  produced at E=8.00 MeV/nucleon by the K500 and K1200  cyclotrons at the
#  NSCL facility. Reaction products were separated using the A1900        
#  fragment separator and detected using two parallel plate avalanche     
#  counters, a Si |DE detector, four Si detectors, and a plastic          
#  scintillator. Measurements of the time-of-flight (TOF), B|r and total  
#  kinetic energy were used to determine the atomic number, mass number   
#  and charge state of reaction products. The |g rays were detected with  
#  an HPGe detector. Isomer half-life were measured using the time        
#  difference between implantation events and HPGe events. Measured       
#  particle spectra, E|g, I|g, (particle)|g-coincidence and half-life of  
#  the isomeric state.
