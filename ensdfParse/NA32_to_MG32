#  2007Ma04: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g|g coin using 8|p               
#  array of 20 HPGe detectors. The |b particles were detected             
#  with SCEPTAR, a nearly 4|p array (at ISAC-TRIUMF facility)             
#  of 20 thick plastic scintillators. The {+32}Na beam produced           
#  by Ta(p,X) at E=500 MeV.                                               
#  2008Tr04: {+32}Na parent produced in reaction {9}Be({+48}Ca,X) with

#  A1900 spectrometer. Products implanted in double-sided silicon         
#  strip detector as part of Beta counting system. Measured half-lives    
#  using time-of-flight. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g using segmented

#  2005Ma96, 2005MA81: Measured E|g, |g|g, |b|g|g, I|g, and lifetime      
#  using an Advanced Time Delayed method. The |b particles were           
#  detected with a thin plastic scintillator, |g-rays detected            
#  with two large volume Ge detectors. The {+32}Na isotope produced       
#  by 1.4 GeV proton induced reaction in UC{-x} graphite target

#  32% {I7} of the decay proceeds by delayed neutron emission;

#  From RADLIST code, deduced energy balance=12250 keV {I430} as compared 
#  to 13410 keV {I1340} from Q value and branching of 68% {I7} for

#B IB,LOGFT$All values are considered as upper limits since there may be  
#B undetected feedings to possible levels between 5-20 MeV. Thus all      
#B corresponding log| {Ift} values are also considered as lower limits    
#G $ EG=239.5 12, IG=28 3 (1984Gu19) is assigned to the decay of          
#G 32NA decay, apparently to feed 32MG, but in 1993Kl02 this |g is        
#G is assigned to delayed one-neutron decay mode                          
#G E,RI$ From 2007Ma04, unless otherwise stated. Values from 1984Gu19,    
#G 1993Kl02 and 2008Tr04 are in agreement but generally less precise.     
#G The spectral purity and statistics is better in 2007Ma04 than in       
#G other studies. Some of the relative gamma-ray intensities in           
#G 2008Tr04 are systematically higher as compared to those in             
#G 2007Ma04 and 1993Kl02, for example, for 1436|g, I|g=15 {12} in         
#G 2008Tr04 while it is near 10 in other three studies quoted above.      
#G Other problematic intensities are for 485|g, 1232|g and 3935|g.        
#G For this reason intensities from 2008Tr04 are not used here.           
#G E(A)$ The |g ray from 2007Ma04 only, assignment to {+32}Na decay       
#G is uncertain.                                                          
#G E(B)$ The 1231.7|g was placed from a 2117 level by 1993Kl02.           
#G Here the revised double placement from |g|g data of 2007Ma04           
#G is adopted; 2117 level is no longer present in the revised level scheme
