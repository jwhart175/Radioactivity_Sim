#  2007Fo06: G-rays were produced in the bombardment of a 203TL target by 
#  neutrons from the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center Weapons Neutron    
#  Research facility. E(N) from 0.6 to 250 MEV, pulsed beams with 775     
#  US repetition period and 1.8 US width. ^GEANIE spectrometer was        
#  comprised of 11 Compton-suppressed ^LEPS, 9 Compton-suppressed HPGe    
#  and 6 unsuppressed HPGe detectors. Measured: G(T), excitation          
#  functions, EG.
