#  1993ReZX: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
#  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
#  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
#  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
#  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderated {+3}He
#  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
#  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
#  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
#  detected in the zero-threshold counter.                                
#  An associated conference report indicates the |b-delayed neutron       
#  probability P{-n}=(6.1 {I3})% and T{-1/2} = 12.4 ms {I3} (the          
#  International conference on nuclear data for science and technology:   
#  nuclear data for the twenty-first century, Gatlinburg, TN (United      
#  States), 9-13 May 1994).                                               
#  Results presented in (1993ReZX) analyzed the data measured in the      
#  polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter and deduced a general value for  
#  the energy of neutrons emitted from the decay; E{-n}=1.38 MeV          
#  {I+86-65}. The value E{-n}=1.3 MeV {I3} is published in the 1994       
#  conference report.
