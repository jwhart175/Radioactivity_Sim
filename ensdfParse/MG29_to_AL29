#  1984GU19: 29MG was produced in the fragmentation of iridium target by  
#  10 GeV protons from the ^CERN synchrotron, recoiled fragments were     
#  thermalized, ionized and mass-separated; Ge(Li) detector, Measured: EG,
#  B-GG COIN, absolute RI.                                                
#  1973GO34: 29MG was produced bombarding Ta{-2}O{-5} target of 99%       
#  enriched in 18O by 13C beam, E=35 MeV from a remote location using     
#  pneumatic system; Ge(Li) and ^NE102 detectors; Measured: EG, RI,       
#  IB, G-B COIN, deduced level energy.                                    
#  1979DE02: 29MG was produced in the fragmentation of uranium target by  
#  24 GeV protons from the ^CERN synchrotron, recoil fragments were       
#  thermalized, ionized and mass-separated; Ge(Li) detector, Measured: EG,
#  absolute IG.

#G E,RI$From 1984Gu19, except otherwise noted. Absolute IG in 1984Gu19    
#G is consistent with the reported absolute IG in 1979De02.               
#L E$Up to 3433 keV, from a least-squares fit to G-ray energies.          
#L Above 3433 keV, level energies are from Adopted Levels.
