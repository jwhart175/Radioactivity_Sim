#  The scheme is from 1994Xu07, who produced the {+157}Yb by an {+16}O    
#       beam on {+147}Sm, with some added data from 1996Xu03 (same        
#       authors).  |g placements are from |g|g coincidence data.          
#  With a Q value of 5500 keV, this decay scheme is clearly very          
#       incomplete since levels are only reported up to 834 keV.          
#            I(|e+|b+) values are given by 1994Xu07, but for two          
#       reasons they are not given here. First, the values of 1994Xu07    
#       depend critically on assumptions concerning the |g-ray            
#       multipolarities. Second, the scheme is very incomplete since      
#       levels are only reported to 834 keV compared to a Q value of      
#       5500 keV. Also, the strongest |g, at 23 keV, is not placed        
#       in this scheme.                                                   
#            The ratio of the intensities of the K x-rays and the 511     
#       photons suggests a major share of the decays are to levels        
#       above 834 KeV and even above 2000 keV.  The largest single        
#       component of the K x ray intensity from internal conversion       
#       will come from the 69 |g and its maximum value will be |? 250     
#       if it is an M1 transition.  Therefore, the measured               
#       I(K|ax) = 1660 {I150}, from which one can calculate that          
#       I(Kx) |? 2100, is primarily from |e decay.  Since                 
#       the I(511) = 821 {I13} should correspond to 2 times the |b+       
#       decays (this assumes all of the |b+ were stopped near the         
#       source), the measured capture to positron ratio is |? 5.          
#       For comparison, the theoretical capture to positron ratios are:   
#       to 0 keV level 0.35, to 835 level 0.65, to a 2000 level 2.0,      
#       and to a 3000 level 10.  Therefore, most of the |e+|b+ decays     
#       are to levels above 2000 keV, assuming that the I(K|ax) and       
#       I(511) are correct.
