#  2009Fo05: {+95}Rb produced through the {+9}Be({+238}U,X) reaction.     
#  {+238}U beam produced at E=80 MeV/nucleon by the K500 and K1200        
#  cyclotrons at the ^NSCL at Michigan State University. Reaction         
#  products were separated using the A1900 fragment separator and         
#  detected using two parallel plate avalanche counters, a Si |DE         
#  detector, four Si detectors, and a plastic scintillator. Measurements  
#  of the time-of-flight, B|r and total kinetic energy were used to       
#  determine the atomic number, mass number and charge state of reaction  
#  products. |g's were detected with one HPGe detector. Half-lives were   
#  measured using the time difference between implantation events and     
#  HPGe events, which was not suitable for measuring half-lives of less   
#  than 500 ns. Measured particle spectra, E|g, I|g,                      
#  (particle)|g-coincidence and half-lives of isomeric states.            
#  Isomer with half-life of <500 ns discovered
