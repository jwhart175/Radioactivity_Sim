#  IN 18N BETA DECAY WAS ANALYZED TO DEDUCE THE 18C BETA-DECAY BRANCH     
#  THAT RESULTS IN 18N POPULATION. %^P{-G}=81 5 WAS DEDUCED; SINCE THE    
#  ONLY OTHER DECAY PATH THAT IS OPEN IS THE |b{+-}1n DECAY TO 17N STATES,
#  THEN %^P{-n}=19 5 IS DEDUCED.                                          
#  A TOTAL OF 9 G-RAY TRANSITIONS IN 18N WERE IDENTIFIED ALONG WITH       
#  2 G-RAY TRANSITIONS IN 17N. THE G-RAY INTENSITIES ARE PRESENTED        
#  IN TWO FORMATS: FIRST THEY ARE GIVEN IN RELATIVE INTENSITY NORMALIZED  
#  TO EG=2614, THE STRONGEST TRANSITION. THE MEASUREMENT ESSENTIALLY      
#  PROVIDED ONLY THE RELATIVE INTENSITY OF G-RAY TRANSITIONS, HENCE THERE 
#  ARE NO BRANCHING RATIOS CORRELATED WITH, FOR EXAMPLE, PER 100 DECAYS.  
#  THE G-RAY DATA IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY OTHER EXPERIMENTAL EFFECTS,   
#  SUCH AS A CLOSE GEOMETRY HAS LED TO LARGE SUMMING CORRECTIONS. IN      
#  ADDITION A POOR EFFICIENCY AT LOW ENERGIES (COUPLED WITH A LONG-LIVED  
#  FIRST EXCITED STATE) HAS LED TO LARGE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN FEEDING INTO
#  THE 18N^*(115) LEVEL AND G-DECAY OUT OF THE LEVEL. IN GENERAL THERE    
#  APPEARS TO BE POOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN FEEDING INTO LEVELS AND DECAY     
#  OUT OF LEVELS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE OVERALL ISSUE HERE         
#  BECAUSE THE SECOND AND FINAL PRESENTATION OF G-RAY INTENSITIES IS      
#  FOR G-DECAY OUT OF EACH LEVEL NORMALIZED FOR THE SUM EQUAL TO 100.     
#  IN SHORT THERE IS NO WAY TO ESTIMATE THE OVERALL SUMMING CORRECTIONS   
#  OR TO EVALUATE THE INTENSITY BALLANCE FOR EACH STATE.                  
#  THE AUTHORS ALSO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE RELATIVE BETA-DECAY FEEDING
#  INTO THE 18N E{-x}=0, 115, 587, 1735 AND 2614 KEV LEVELS OF IB=        
#  0, 0, LT 1, 11 8 AND 89 11%. USING THE G-DECAY BRANCHING RATIOS FOR    
#  EACH LEVEL, THE RELATIVE BETA-DECAY FEEDING AND THE PN VALUE IT IS     
#  POSSIBLE TO DEDUCE A BETA-DECAY SCHEME. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE        
#  ISSUES ABOVE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE RENORMALIZATION FOR THE   
#  G-RAY TRANSITIONS FOR |g-DECAY IN 17N. THE EG=879.7 KEV TRANSITION     
#  BETWEEN 18N^*(2614 -->1735) IS THE STRONGEST TRANSITION THAT HAS NO    
#  SUMMING CORRECTION, SO IT SEEMS MOST REASONABLE TO SCALE WITH THIS.    
#  1995SC03: A BEAM OF 18C IONS WAS PRODUCED BY FRAGMENTING A 22NE BEAM   
#  ON A 9BE TARGET. THE BEAM WAS MAGNETICALLY SEPARATED, DEGRADED TO      
#  LOWER ENERGIES, AND FINALLY STOPPED IN A PLASTIC IMPLANTAION           
#  SCINTILLATOR DETECTOR. THE BEAM CARRIED a < 4% 20N IMPURITY.           
#  THE 20N IONS WERE STOPPED IN AN ABSORBER UPSTREAM OF THE IMPLANTATION  
#  DETECTOR, AND NO ASSOCIATED ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED.                     
#  THE DATA WERE COLLECTED WITH A 206 MS BEAM-ON/ 222 MS BEAM-OFF CYCLE.  
#  NEUTRONS WERE DETECTED IN ONE OF 15 PLASTIC SCINTALLATOR BARS THAT     
#  FORMED AN ARRAY SURROUNDING THE TARGET WITH A 99.7 CM FLIGHT PATH.     
#  THE NEUTRON ENERGIES WERE DETERMINED BY ^ToF BETWEEN THE IMPLANTATION  
#  DETECTOR AND THE NEUTRON ARRAY WITH EN ENERGY THRESHOLD OF 750 KEV.    
#  THE ^ToF ANALYSIS PERMITTED ANALYSIS OF BACKGROUND EVENTS FROM         
#  18C DECAY DAUGHTERS (18N AND 17N).                                     
#  SEVEN NEUTRON ENERGY GROUPS WERE OBSERVED THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO       
#  18C DECAY. THE LACK OF NEUTRON-GAMMA COINCIDENCE DATA PRECLUDES THE    
#  ASSIGNMENT OF ANY NEUTRON GROUPS TO DECAYS OTHER THAN TO THE GROUND    
#  STATE; HENCE, THE ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT FOR THIS CASE. THE INTENSITY 
#  OF BETA-DELAYED NEUTRON DECAYS WAS MEASURED AS %B-N=(21.4 44)%.

#  THE PN=(43.3 65)% VALUE IS ACCEPTED, THE RELATIVE BETA-DECAY           
#  FEEDING TO 18N LEVELS AND G-RAY BRANCHING RATIOS GIVEN IN 1991PR03     
#  ARE ACCEPTED AND SHOULD BE NORMALIZED FOR %|b{+-}0n=66.7 65.           
#  SIGNIFICANT |b{+-}1n DECAY STRENGTH IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR.              
#  THE PN=(43.3 65)% VALUE OF (1991RE02) IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER          
#  THAN THE OTHER FINDINGS. THE ZERO-ENERGY THRESHOLD                     
#  OF (1991RE02) IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IMPLEMENTED IN THE           
#  OTHER MEASUREMENTS, HENCE INVOLVEMENT OF BETA-DECAY TO STATES          
#  THAT DECAY WITH LOW-ENERGY NEUTRONS MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THE DECAY.      
#  THERE ARE NO KNOWN 18N LEVELS ABOVE THE NEUTRON SEPARATION THRESHOLD,  
#  SO, AT THE MOMENT THE NEUTRON ENERGY GROUPS MAY ONLY BE ASSOCIATED     
#  WITH DECAY TO THE GROUND STATE. THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR NEUTRON DECAY
