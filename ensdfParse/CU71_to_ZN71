#  1983Ru06: {+71}Cu produced by W({+72}Ge,X) at E=9 MeV/nucleon from     
#  UNILAC at GSI facility. The reaction products were stopped in a        
#  30 mg/cm{+2} graphite catcher in FEBIAD-E ion source of the on-line    
#  mass separator. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|b, |b, isotopic half-life  
#  using two Ge(Li) detectors at |q=180|' and a plastic scintillator      
#  1999Pr10: {+71}Cu from fragmentation of {+76}Ge beam with              
#  Be target at NSCL facility. Measured E|g, |g|g, isotopic half-life.    
#  A 1298|g was seen in coin with 490|g and seven |g rays were shown      
#  in a spectrum between 1150 and 1660 keV. The authors stated that       
#  there were discrepancies between their data and those from 1983Ru06,   
#  but details of this study are not yet available.                       
#  The decay scheme given here from 1983Ru06 is considered incomplete     
#  in view of a gap of about 2.2 MeV between Q value and the highest level
#  at 2377 keV, where additional levels and |g rays could be present.     
#  Moreover, some |g-ray spectra shown by 1999Pr10 show additional        
#  transitions assigned to this decay, albeit, unplaced at present.       
#B IB,LOGFT$ As explained above in the header comments of the dataset,    
#B the decay scheme is incomplete, thus all |b feedings are considered as 
#B upper limits and associated log {Ift} values as lower limits.          
#B $The |g-ray intensity balance at 674.7 level gives negative |b feeding 
#B of -5.5% {I25}                                                         
#G $ All |g's were observed in coincidence with |b's                      
#G E(D),RI(D)$ Unresolved doublet, the second component belongs to        
#G {+71}Zn decay. 1983Ru06 probably divided the intensity amongst the two 
#G components
