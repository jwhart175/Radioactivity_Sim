#G           1979Ab18 STATE THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE UNPLACED            
#G  TRANSITIONS IS NOT MORE THAN 12% OF THE 155HO DECAYS.                 
#G           1979Al31 state that the errors in the ICE values are no more 
#G than 20%.                                                              
#G           Normalization of the electron intensity scale, relative to   
#G that of the |g rays, was accomplished by requiring that EKC=0.0256     
#G for the prominent 240.19 G, which is the theoretical value for an E1   
#G transition. An E1 multipolarity for this transition has been           
#G established from the L-subshell ratios, as measured by, for example,   
#G 1979Ab18.

#G RI        I(DY XKA1)=306 30 (1979Ab18).                                
#G M         Deduced from the EKC data of 1979Ab18, unless noted otherwise
#G MR        Calculated from the measured L-subshell ratios of 1979Al31,  
#G unless otherwise noted                                                 
#G CC        For mixed transitions for which MR is not known, the listed  
#G value was calculated assuming MR=1                                     
#L E         Listed values obtained from a least-squares fit to the
