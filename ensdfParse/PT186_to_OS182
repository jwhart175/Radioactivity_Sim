#  The data listed here are essentially from 2003Ba44 (Nuclear Data       
#  Sheets for A=186)                                                      
#  T{-1/2}({+186}Pt)=2.08 h {I5} used here is the unweighted average of   
#  the measured half-lives: 2.5 h {I5} (1955Sm42), 2.2 h {I2} (1963Gr08), 
#  2.0 h {I1} (1972Fi12) and 2.10 h {I5} (1991Be25).

#  |a decay branching of 0.00010% {I4} is calculated from r{-0}=1.50 {I2}.
#  %|a|?0.00014% was deduced by 1963Gr08 by assuming that neighboring     
#  mass nuclei were produced in equal quantities. The branching was       
#  estimated by 1963Gr08 to be correct within a factor of 2.              
#  The radius parameter is calculated to be r{-0}=1.518, r{-0}=1.574 and  
#  r{-0}=1.485 for %|a=0.00014, %|a=0.00028 and %|a=0.00007, respectively.
#  %|a=0.00010 {I4} is obtained from the estimated r{-0}. The value given 
#  here is from 2003Ba44 evaluation for A=186.
