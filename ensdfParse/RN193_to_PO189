#  {+193}Rn produced and identified in {+144}Sm({+52}Cr,3n) reaction at   
#  E=252 MeV; {+144}SmF{-3} rotating target onto a carbon backing.        
#  UNILAC heavy-ion facility at GSI, with SHIP velocity filter for        
#  separating evaporation residues.                                       
#  Detector system: Several different types of detectors were used:       
#  The decays of the evaporation residues were measured                   
#  by implanting residues in a thick 16-strip position-sensitive silicon  
#  detector (PSSD) with a typical FWHM |? 20 keV for |a particles         
#  in 6-8 MeV range. An array of six silicon detectors of similar shape   
#  (BOX detectors), mounted upstream of PSSD detector, was used to        
#  measure the energies of |a, |b and conversion electrons.               
#  Three thin time-of-flight detectors in front of the PSSD and BOX       
#  detectors permitted identification of reaction products from the       
#  scattered beam particles; and distinction between the decay events     
#  and implantation events through anti-coincidence technique.            
#  An additional thick Si detector was installed as a veto detector       
#  behind the PSSD detector in an anti-coincidence mode. This allowed     
#  distinction between the decays and the punch-through events (from      
#  high-energy protons and |a particles produced in the reactions         
#  on the carbon backing). For |g rays, a four-fold segmented 'Clover'    
#  Ge detector was used behind the PSSD detectors for prompt and delayed  
#  |g(residues) coin and/or |a|g coin measurements.                       
#  Measured |a, |g, |a|g coin, |a(residues) coin, |g(residues) coin.
