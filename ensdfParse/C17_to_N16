#  1995SC03: ^A BEAM OF 17C IONS WAS PRODUCED BY FRAGMENTING A 22NE BEAM  
#  ON A 9BE TARGET.  THE BEAM WAS MAGNETICALLY SEPARATED, DEGRADED TO     
#  LOWER ENERGIES, AND FINALLY STOPPED IN A PLASTIC IMPLANTAION           
#  SCINTILLATOR DETECTOR. THE BEAM CARRIED A LT 14% 14B IMPURITY.         
#  THE DATA WERE COLLECTED WITH A 607 MS BEAM-ON/ 583 MS BEAM-OFF CYCLE.  
#  NEUTRONS WERE DETECTED IN ONE OF 15 PLASTIC SCINTALLATOR BARS THAT     
#  FORMED AN ARRAY SURROUNDING THE TARGET WITH A 99.7 CM FLIGHT PATH.     
#  THE NEUTRON ENERGIES WERE DETERMINED BY ^ToF                           
#  BETWEEN THE IMPLANTATION DETECTOR AND THE NEUTRON ARRAY.               
#  THE ^ToF ANALYSIS PERMITTED SUBTRACTION OF BACKGROUND EVENTS FROM      
#  14B BEAM IMPURITIES AND 17C DECAY DAUGHTERS (17N AND 16N), RESULTING   
#  IN FOUR NEUTRON ENERGY GROUPS AT E{-N}=1.62, 1.93, 2.82 AND 3.73 MEV   
#  THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO 17C DECAY. THE TWO HIGHER-ENERGY GROUPS ARE     
#  QUITE BROAD AND ARE ATTRIBUTED TO UNRESOLVED DECAY DOUBLETS AT         
#  E{-N}=2.25 MEV 2 AND 2.91 MEV 3, AND E{-N}=3.35 MEV 3 AND 3.86 MEV 3,  
#  RESPECTIVELY. THE DECAY DOUBLETS ARE POSSIBLY ATTRIBUTED TO, FOR       
#  EXAMPLE, DECAY FROM A STATE IN 17N TO TWO LOW-LYING STATES IN 16N.     
#  NOTE: THE EXCITATION ENERGIES SUGGESTED IN FOOTNOTES ^c AND ^d         
#  FOR TABLE 1 DO NOT APPEAR TO CORRELATE WITH THE DECAY KINEMATICS.
