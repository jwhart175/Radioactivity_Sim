#  2014Wa26: a high-spin isomer in {+126}Pd produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,F) 
#  reaction at 345 MeV/nucleon at RIBF-RIKEN facility. Residual nuclei of 
#  interest were separated and identified using BigRIPS and ZeroDegree    
#  spectrometer. A total of 53,000 {+126}Pd fragments were implanted in   
#  a highly segmented active stopper WAS3ABi consisting of eight double-  
#  sided silicon-strip detectors (DSSSDs). These detectors were used for  
#  detecting |b particles as well as conversion electrons form highly-    
#  converted transitions in {126}Pd. The gamma rays were detected using   
#  EURICA array with 12 Cluster-type HPGe detectors with a timing         
#  window of 100 |ms relative to the trigger signal from a plastic        
#  scintillator placed at the end of the beam line. Measured E|g, I|g,    
#  (particle)|g(delayed) coincidence. Deduced levels in {+126}Pd and      
#  {+126}Ag, J, |p, half-lives of isomer and ground state of {+126}Pd.
