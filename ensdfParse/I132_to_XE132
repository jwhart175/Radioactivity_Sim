#  1978Ne08: Measured E|g, I|g. Results of E|g and I|g from previous      
#  studies (1971We15 and adopted values in 1970Ca04) combined with        
#  their own results and also with independent I|g measurements           
#  from the Livermore group using a chemically-separated {+132}I source.  
#  The authors give averaged E|g and I|g as adopted values. Earlier       
#  papers from the same laboratory with some of the same authors:
