#  DATA SET UPDATED (OCTOBER, 2003) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE A NEW QP VALUE,
#  NEW NR VALUE, REVISED JPI VALUE FOR THE 226 LEVEL AND NEW COMMENTS.    
#  1991To08: sources with mass 155 were produced in the 95MO+64ZN         
#  reaction, followed by mass separation and transport to detection       
#  systems. SI particle DE-E telescope, plastic scintillator, HPGE and    
#  ^Ge detectors. Measured EA, EG, RI, GG, GX, AG, G(T).                  
#  1977Ag01: source produced by the (P,XN) reaction in natural ER,        
#  followed by on-line mass separation. Measured G and CE spectra and G-G 
#  coincidences.                                                          
#  THE LEVEL SCHEME IS PROBABLY INCOMPLETE AND THUS NO DEDUCED EC+B+      
#   INTENSITIES ARE LISTED, AS THEY MAY BE LARGER THAN THE TRUE ONES.     
#   HOWEVER, A NR VALUE IS GIVEN, BASED ON THE SUMMED G+CE FEEDING OF     
#   THE GS; AND THIS HAS BEEN USED TO COMPUTE A %|a VALUE FOR THE         
#   21.6 S ACTIVITY IN 155TM. TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF THE UNPLACED     
#   |g's FEED THE GS, THIS %|a VALUE MAY BE LARGER THAT THE TRUE          
#   ONE (see THE COMMENT ON THIS VALUE IN THE 155TM Adopted Levels,       
#   Gammas Data Set).                                                     
#G           In addition to the G's listed here, 1977Ag01 report |g's     
#G with energies of 171.6, 323.5, 433.4, 497.0 and, presumably, 507       
#G that are not shown here. Comparison of the RI data of 1991To08 (which  
#G involve the 45-s 155TM activity only) with those of 1977Ag01 indicates 
#G that these G's are not associated with the decay of the activity       
#G under consideration here (the 21.6-s activity).                        
#G E         The |g's listed as unplaced are those reported by 1977Ag01.  
#G Since the sources used in this study contained both 155TM activities,  
#G some of these |g's may in fact be associated with the other (the       
#G 45-s) 155TM activity.

#G           The CE intensities were normalized to those of the G rays    
#G using the value of EKC for the 202.4 G in 155DY (from the 155HO EC     
#G decay). This procedure introduces an additional error of 20% in the    
#G values of the conversion coefficients (1977Ag01).                      
#G M         The listed assignments are derived from a comparison of      
#G EKC with theoretical values                                            
#G E(A)      Assignment of this transition to the 155TM EC decay is

#G RI(B)     Value derived from the difference of the RI values of        
#G 1977Ag01 (composite source) and 1991To08 (45-s activity only). The two 
#G intensity scales were normalized to the RI(323.5G) value of 1977Ag01   
#G before carrying out the subtraction.

#G           The CE-related data are from 1977Ag01 (whose study included  
#G gammas from the decay of both 155TM activities). For a discussion of   
#G this information, see the 155TM EC decay (21.6 S) data set.            
#G M         The listed assignments are derived from a comparison of

#G E         A number of gammas from the 155TM decay are reported         
#G by 1977Ag01 that are not placed in their 155ER level scheme (see the   
#G 155TM EC decay (21.6 2) data set for a listing). Since the sources     
#G used by these authors contained both activities, some of these         
#G gammas may in fact be associated with this (the 45-s) 155TM activity.
