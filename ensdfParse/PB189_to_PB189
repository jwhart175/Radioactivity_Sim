#  2005Ba51: {+158}Gd({+36}Ar,5n|g): E=178 MeV.  Target=0.43 mg/cm{+2}    
#  92.9% enriched {+158}Gd. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g,                      
#  particle-|g coin with 10 Compton-suppressed Ge detectors and           
#  parallel-grid avalanche counter (PGAC).  Fragment mass analyzer (FMA)  
#  used to accept evaporation residues recoiling from target according to 
#  their mass/charge ratio.  Reaction products detected by PGAC via energy
#  loss (|DE) and focal-plane-position signals.                           
#  {+164}Er({+29}Si,4n|g): E=140 MeV.  Target=2.5 mg/cm{+2} 73.6% enriched
#  {+164}Er. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|g(t),                            
#  lifetimes with six Compton-suppressed Ge detectors and two planar low  
#  energy photon spectrometer (LEPS) detectors of the CAESAR array.       
#  2009Dr03: {+164}Er beam produced at E=145 MeV by 14UD Pelletron        
#  accelerator at Australian National University. Target=700 |mg/cm{+2}.  
#  A spectrometer,                                                        
#  consisting of the fusion product separator SOLITAIRE, an annular array 
#  of six cooled Si(Li) electron detectors, a single large-volume Ge      
#  detector and a single LEPS detector, were used to measure both |g rays 
#  and electrons. CAESAR array of Ge detectors was used in complementary  
#  experiments                                                            
#G RI$Values are from out-of-beam measurements. Intensities from          
#G in-beam measurements are given under comments for those transitions    
#G for which values have been deduced. All values scaled down by a factor 
#G of five by the compilers so as to renormalize the decay scheme to an   
#G intensity of 100 for the 818 |g-ray.                                   
#G M(Z)$Measured |a(exp) implies E0 admixture                             
#G $|a(exp)'s have been determined from intensity balance considerations.
