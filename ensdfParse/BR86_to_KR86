#  1978LeZA (Table of Isotopes-1978): the decay scheme is adopted from a  
#  private communication in 1977 from S. Prussin (University of           
#  California, Berkeley). In comparison to earlier studies by 1975Hu02    
#  and 1972Ac01, about 30 additional gamma rays and six new levels were   
#  reported in this communication, and the precision of E|g and I|g values
#  was significantly better than that in previous studies. Consultation   
#  by one of the evaluators (in February 2001) with S. Prussin suggested  
#  that their work was not published, and a copy of the private           
#  communication submitted to 1978LeZA was no longer available. A copy was
#  neither available from LBNL Isotopes Project. But in view of better    
#  energy and intensity precisions in this experiment, evaluators adopt   
#  most of the results of this study as given in 1978LeZA compilation     
#  1975HU02: measured EG, IG, T1/2; no level scheme is given in this paper

#  2014Fi09: Modular Total Absorption Spectrometer (MTAS) system at       
#  HRIBF-ORNL facility used to obtain true beta feedings and average      
#  energy of emitted |g radiation as 4110 keV in contrast to 3260 keV     
#  from the decay scheme presented here. Authors introduced 65 pseudo     
#  levels to fit the observed total absorption spectrum                   
#  Level scheme is mainly from 1972Ac01, with some modifications in       
#  1978LeZA. Total absorption spectra in 2014Fi09 suggest that this       
#  level scheme is incomplete, and further state-of-the-art gamma-ray     
#  studies are needed to improve upon the knowledge of this decay scheme, 
#  and obtain some level of consistency with the total gamma

#B IB,LOGFT$Since the decay scheme is considered (by the evaluator)       
#B as incomplete, all B- feedings and associated LOGFT
