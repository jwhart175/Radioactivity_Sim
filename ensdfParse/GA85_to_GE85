#  2013Ko31: measured E|g, I|g, |b|g|g-coin, |b|g-coin at HRIBF. Level    
#  scheme of {+85}Ge is proposed. See experimental details in 2012Ma37    
#  2012Ma37: {+85}Ga produced in fission of U with 50 MeV proton beam.    
#  Target=6 g/cm{+2} thick UC{-x} located at target ion source assembly   
#  mounted on the Injector for Radioactive Ion Species 2 (IRIS-2) at HRIBF
#  facility at ORNL. Fission products were separated by electromagnetic   
#  system. Separated ions were transmitted to Low energy Radioactive Ion  
#  beam Spectroscopy Station (LeRIBSS). Ions at 200 keV energy were       
#  deposited on a tape in the Moving Tape Collector located in the middle 
#  of |b-|g counting system consisting of four Ge Clovers and two plastic 
#  scintillators. Measured |b-gated |g spectra and half-lives.            
#  Half-life of isotope was measured by fitting the growth and decay      
#  curves of |g rays assigned to |b-|g or |b|g-neutron channels after     
#  subtraction of background. Comparison with theoretical calculations    
#  using density functional model.                                        
#  Gamma ray assigned to |b{+-}n decay of {+85}Ga to {+84}Ge: 624.3 keV.  
#  A |g ray at 107.8 keV is assigned to decay of {+85}Ga (2012Ma37)       
#  2010Wi03: {+85}Ga from {+238}U(p,F),E=54 MeV; products were accelerated
#  to 225 MeV in the ORNL Tandem. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g,                
#  (fragment)|g coin (ion-tagged |g-ray spectra), |b|g(ion) coin,         
#  |bn|g coin using an array composed of four Ge clover and two plastic   
#  scintillator detectors. Ion-tagging technique for assignment of |g rays
#  to the decay of {+85}Ga. Comparison with spherical HFB calculations.
