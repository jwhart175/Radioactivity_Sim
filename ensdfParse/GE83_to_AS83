#  {+83}Ge activity from thermal neutron induced fission of {+235}U.      
#  Products mass separated and deposited onto a moving tape collector.    
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g(t), |b|g and |g|g coincidences using a Ge(Li)    
#  detector, a HPGe detector, and a thin plastic scintillator.            
#  Decay-scheme normalization was not calculated because |b{+-}           
#  population to {+83}As g.s. is unknown. Authors deduced log| {Ift}      
#  values (not shown here) based on |b{+-} decay of the isotone           
#  {+85}Se to {+85}Br.                                                    
#G E(A),RI(A)$From spectrum in coincidence with 306|g.                    
#L E$From a least-squares fit to E|g, by evaluator.
