#  1996RA02: ^A BEAM OF 17B IONS WAS PRODUCED BY FRAGMENTING A 22NE BEAM  
#  ON A 9BE TARGET. THE BEAM WAS MAGNETICALLY SEPARATED, DEGRADED TO      
#  LOWER ENERGIES, AND FINALLY STOPPED IN A PLASTIC SCINTILLATOR.         
#  THE IMPLANTATION DETECTOR WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN FOUR OTHER            
#  SCINTILLATOR                                                           
#  DETECTORS, AND A VALID EVENT REQUIRED A COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THREE      
#  AJACENT DETECTORS. THREE NEUTRON WALLS SURROUNDED THE IMPLANTATION     
#  TARGET AND COVERED ABOUT 1.4 SR. THE DECAY NEUTRON ENERGY WAS          
#  DEDUCED BY THE TIME OF FLIGHT BETWEEN THE IMPLANTATION DETECTOR AND    
#  THE NEUTRON WALL DETECTORS. THE ^ToF WAS CALIBRATED BY STUDYING THE    
#  DECAY OF 17N WHICH HAS THREE VISIBLE KNOWN NEUTRON GROUPS.             
#       THE MEASURED NEUTRON SPECTRUM SHOWS TWO PROMINENT DECAY GROUPS    
#  FROM 17B BETA DELAYED NEUTRON DECAY AT E{-N}= 2.91 AND 1.80 MEV, AS    
#  WELL AS, A STRONG PEAK AT E{-N}=0.82 MEV FROM THE DAUGHTER 16N DECAY.  
#  A FULL ANALYSIS OF THE NEUTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM REVEALED TWO NEUTRON    
#  GROUPS CORRESPONDING TO KNOWN BRANCHES IN 16N DECAY AND FOUR GROUPS    
#  THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO 17B DECAY. THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED BY         
#  NORMALIZING TO ^%B-1N= 63% 1 FROM (1988DU09).
