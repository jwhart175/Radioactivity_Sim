#  92BR produced through the {+9}Be({+238}U,X) reaction. 238U             
#  beam produced at E=8.00 MeV/nucleon by the ^K500 and ^K1200            
#  cyclotrons at the National Superconducting Laboratory at Michigan      
#  State University. Reaction products were separated using the ^A1900    
#  fragment separator and detected using two parallel plate avalanche     
#  counters, a Si DE detector, four Si detectors, and a plastic           
#  scintillator. Measurements of the time-of-flight, B|r and total        
#  kinetic energy were used to determine the atomic number, mass number   
#  and charge state of reaction products. |g's were detected with one     
#  HPGe detector. Half-lives were measured using the time difference      
#  between implantation events and HPGe events, unsuitable                
#  for measuring half-lives of less than 500 ns. Measured particle        
#  spectra, EG, IG, (particle)-G-coincidence and half-lives of            
#  isomeric states.                                                       
#  Isomer with half-life of <500 ns discovered; no level scheme           
#  proposed, but several scenarios have been presented in the             
#  discussion
