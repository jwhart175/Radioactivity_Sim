#  2012Ka36: {+122}Rh produced in Be({+238}U,X), beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon
#  provided by the RIBF accelerator complex at RIKEN facility. Fission    
#  fragments were separated and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, then       
#  transported to focal plane of ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally      
#  implanted in an aluminum stopper. Particle identification was achieved 
#  by |DE-tof-B|r method. Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were
#  detected by three clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g,       
#  |g|g-coin, isomer half-life. Deduced levels                            
#G E(X)$ Reverse ordering of the 63.9-207.1 |g cascade is also possible
