#B IB,LOGFT$ The %B- feedings and associated LOGFT values are considered  
#B as only approximate. There exists the possibility of unobserved        
#B transitions from possible high lying levels as suggested by the        
#B inconsistency of LOGFT value=5.6 to 1607 level with JPI=(3+) and       
#B LOGFT=5.9 to 1847 level with JPI=(6+). For JPI=5+ for the              
#B parent state, the 1607 level must have negligible B- feeding.          
#B It should be noted that large gap of about 3 MEV between Q- value of   
#B 6384 and highest known level at 3647 allows possible unobserved higher
