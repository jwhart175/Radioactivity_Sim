#  Slightly modified by E. Browne (August 2006)                           
#  The observed fission activity was interpreted in 1972Sk03              
#  as due to SF decay of a shape isomer in 234PU                          
#  following EC decay of 234AM, and confirmed in 1990Ha02                 
#  by observation of prompt coincidences between                          
#  plutonium K X-RAYS and fission products.                               
#  234AM EC decay to deformed states in the first well of the potential   
#  energy in 234PU has not been studied.                                  
#G E(D)      Reported in 1990Ha02 in coincidence with fission             
#G products. These transitions were found to be very weak,                
#G and they should be considered as "not well established ".
