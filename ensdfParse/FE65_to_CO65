#  {+65}Fe produced by 30-MeV proton-induced fission reaction on {+238}U  
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |b|g|g-coin, half-lives with plastic                
#  scintillation |b detectors and MINIBALL |g detectors. The experiments  
#  conducted at LISOL facility at CRC center in Belgium                   
#  {+65}Fe decay also studied in deep inelastic                           
#  reaction: {+238}U({+64}Ni,X) E=430 MeV. Measured delayed |g rays.      
#B IB,LOGFT$ All |b feedings, which have been deduced by the evaluators,  
#B should be considered upper limits. Thus, associated log| {Ift} values  
#B are lower limits, due to possible missed |g rays.

#G deep inelastic reaction are given under comments. These values
