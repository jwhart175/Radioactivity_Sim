#  NEW DATA SET, PREPARED (N0VEMBER, 1997) BY CW REICH                    
#  All data are from the decay study of 1996Bi07, unless noted otherwise  
#  166PT produced in the 92MO(78KR,4n) reaction, with E(78KR)=348 MEV.    
#  Enriched (GT 97% 92MO) metal-foil target of thickness 0.565 MG/CM2.    
#  The recoil products were separated according to their mass-to-charge   
#  ratio in the ^Fragment ^Mass ^Analyzer at the ^ATLAS accelerator       
#  facility. After passing through a thin position-sensitive              
#  parallel-grid avalanche counter, located at the focal plane of the     
#  analyzer, the recoils were implanted in a double-sided silicon-strip   
#  detector. Both position and time correlations between the recoil       
#  nuclei and their decay products were studied. Measured T and EA.
