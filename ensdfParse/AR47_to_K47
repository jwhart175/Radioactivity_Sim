#H TYP=FUL$AUT=T. W. BURROWS$CIT=NDS 108, 923 (2007)$CUT=20-Feb-2007$     
#  PRODUCED BY A PULSED BEAM OF 1.4 GEV PROTONS (3E+13 PROTONS/PULSE) FROM
#  THE ^PSB ACCELERATOR IMPINGING ON A STANDARD ISOLDE URANIUM CARBIDE    
#  GRAPHITE TARGET, HEATED TO ABOUT 1900 DEG C. THE REACTION PRODUCTS     
#  DIFFUSED FROM THE HEATED TARGET AND EFFUSED {Ivia} A LOW-TEMPERATURE,  
#  WATER-COOLED TRANSFER LINE TO A STANDARD ^FEBIAD ^MK-7 PLASMA ION      
#  SOURCE, WHERE THE IONIZATION BY PLASMA DISCHARGE TOOK PLACE. A TUNGSTEN
#  CONVERTER WAS PLACED PARALLEL TO THE TARGET, ALLOWING ONE TO SWITCH TO 
#  THE NEUTRON IRRADIATION OF THE TARGET BY CHANGING THE FOCUS OF THE     
#  PROTON BEAM FROM THE TARGET TO THE CONVERTER. MEASURED EG, EB, IG, IB, 
#  GG- AND BG-COIN, AND T USING TWO Ge DETECTORS AND FOUR 1.5-mm THICK    
#  PLASTIC DETECTORS (FOR DETECTING B-'S).                                
#  THE LEVEL SCHEME IS TENTATIVE AS STATED BY 2004WE09. THE POSITION OF   
#  FIRST TWO EXCITED STATES AND THEIR TRANSITIONS WERE KNOWN FROM         
#  48CA(48CA,XG). 1742G AND 3822G PLACED ACCORDING TO COINCIDENCE         
#  RELATIONS. THE RELATIVELY STRONG 3718 IS NOT OBSERVED IN COINCIDENCE   
#  WITH OTHER G'S AND, THEREFORE, ASSUMED TO DEEXCITE THE 3718 STATE.     
#  2020G, 3420G, AND 3357G PLACED SOLELY ON THEIR ENERGIES.               
#B IB        ALL BRANCHING RATIOS ARE NORMALIZED BASED ON THE TOTAL DECAY 
#B STRENGTH DEDUCED FROM INTENSITIES OF THE G'S FROM 47K DECAY.

#B IB(D)     OBSERVED 47K ACTIVITY CORRESPONDS TO THE BUILDUP OF THE 47AR 
#B DAUGHTER. THEREFORE, INTENSITIES OF THE 586G AND 2013 G OF 47K         
#B REPRESENT 79% AND 93% OF THE TOTAL 47AR DECAY FLUX, RESPECTIVELY. THE  
#B TOTAL STRENGTH OF 47AR DECAY MEASURED IN THESE GAMMA'S IS 174 13 IN THE
#B SAME RELATIVE UNITS AS GIVEN FOR THE 47AR DECAY GAMMA'S. THIS VALUE    
#B SHOULD BE COMPARED TO THE SUMOF IG(TO GS), 128 3. UNDETECTED DECAY TO  
#B THE GS IS ASSUMED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REST OF THE DECAY STRENGTH,
#B 46 13, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO A 26% 8 DECAY BRANCHING TO THE GS
