#  1998Hw04: measured |g|g|g and higher with                              
#  Gammasphere, 72 Compton-suppressed Ge detectors. Assignment            
#  based on Cs-Tc SF pairs and 80.1|g observed in {+140}Xe                
#  |b decay.                                                              
#  1974ClZX: measured |g, |g|g, |g(t)                                     
#  1970Wa05: measured ce, ce(t)

#  Z and A identification from multiparameter coincidences.               
#  There is no overlap between the Levels and Gammas reported by          
#  1998Hw04 and the previous references in this data set, except          
#  presumably for 79.4|g from 1998Hw04. Slightly lower energy unplaced |g 
#  consistent with this value within uncertainty was previously reported. 
#L E$Fit on levels: |DE|g=1 keV was assumed for the |g's reported with    
#L no uncertainty

#G RI$Note that reported absolute values of Ice(K)(78|g,118|g)            
#G (1970Wa05) result in I|g values which are probably                     
#G inconsistent with absolute                                             
#G values for I(103|g) and I(51|g) reported in 1974ClZX.                  
#G For example, I(118|g)=0.0176/fission (derived from ce(K)=0.0088        
#G assuming |a(K)(M1)|?0.5, whereas I(103|g)=0.00093/fission, {Ii.e.}
