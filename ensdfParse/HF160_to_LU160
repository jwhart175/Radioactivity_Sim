#  DATA SET UPDATED (APRIL, 2004) BY CW REICH TO CHANGE Q(e.c.).          
#  Production: ^Hf isotopes were produced in fusion evaporation reactions 
#  on enriched (92.7% {+135}Ba) BaF{-2} targets. The reactions were       
#  induced by 32S ions at five different energies ranging from 214 MEV    
#  down to 172 MEV, the energies being reduced from the initial beam      
#  energy (240 MEV) by use of ^Ta beam degrader foils. The reaction       
#  products were thermalized, swept out with a ^He jet flow and sprayed   
#  onto a tape, which periodically moved them into a detection system.    
#  Excitation functions were used to provide mass-number assignments.     
#  Element assignment was done by measurement of coincident X-RAYS        
#  from internally converted transitions and/or emitted after electron    
#  capture.                                                               
#  The radiations were studied using two high-resolution ^Ge detectors    
#  in a close 180 DEG geometry with a 4.50 CM2 ^Si surface-barrier |a     
#  detector placed between them. Two previously unknown G rays were       
#  assigned to the EC decay of 160HF. They are not in coincidence with    
#  each other and their placement in the 160LU level scheme is not        
#  established at present (although they may both be GS transitions).     
#  Their reported properties are as follows:                              
#
