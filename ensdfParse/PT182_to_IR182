#  2007Ho20: Measured E|g, I|g, ce, |g(ce) using a Si(Li) detector and an 
#  HPGe detector. The ce data were measured using a magnetic spectrometer 
#  and a Si(Li) detector. The source of {+182}Pt obtained from            
#  successive decay of mass-separated {+182}Hg isotope formed in          
#  Pb(p,X), 1 GeV protons, CERN-PS booster facility. 2000Ro41 from        
#  the same group report multipolarity assignments for 21 transitions     
#  from 17.8 to 123.4 keV, consistent with those in 2007Ho20              
#  1995Sa42: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|g(t) using a planar HPGe,        
#  x-ray detector and two coaxial HPGe detectors                          
#  1999Sa40: Conversion electron measurements for four transitions        
#  2007Ho20, 1995Sa42 and 1999Sa40 are from the same group.               
#  Others:                                                                
#  1975Ho03: measured |b strength function; population of levels          
#  indicated from 800 keV to |?3 MeV                                      
#  1970FiZZ: measured E|g, I|g for four |g rays at 136.0, 146.0,          
#  186.0 and 210.0. All are reported by 1995Sa42, except that 210|g       
#  is very weak in 1995Sa42                                               
#  All data are from 2007Ho20, unless indicated otherwise                 
#E TI$ Deduced by the evaluators from I|g+ce intensity balance. The       
#E 2007Ho20 list |e+|b{++} feedings and associated log| {Ift} values only 
#E some of the levels. Comparison of the two sets shows small deviations, 
#E but the agreement is within the quoted uncertainties                   
#E TI(Y)$ Too high to be realistic for |DJ involved in |b decay           
#G $ All |g rays assigned in the level scheme were seen in |g|g coin      
#G data of 1995Sa42.                                                      
#G $ When |d is given as approximate, 50% arbitrary uncertainty in this   
#G value is assumed by the evaluators in deducing total conversion        
#G coefficient                                                            
#G E$|D(E|g) assigned as 0.2 keV for I|g>5 and E|g>500; and 0.3 keV       
#G or 1 keV for others, based on a general statement by 1995Sa42.         
#G 1995Sa42 state that weak |g rays (I|g<0.5) that were observed          
#G only in coin with Ir x rays were not listed in their paper, but        
#G several weak (I|g<0.5) |g rays are given by 2007Ho20.                  
#G RI,TI$ Intensities quoted by 2007Ho20 are divided by a factor of 10.   
#G M$From ce data. Unless otherwise noted, the K conversion coefficients  
#G above 185 keV are from |g and Si(Li) ce singles spectra.               
#G The conversion coefficients below 185 keV are from |g and singles ce   
#G spectra with a spectrograph. The subshell ratios are from |g and       
#G spectrograph ce singles spectra. The |g ray and ce intensities were    
#G normalized to well-known stretched E2 transitions in {+182}Ir.         
#G M(a)$ Subshell ratios are from singles electron spectra.               
#G M(e)$ The conversion coefficients are based on (ce)|g and |g|g         
#G coincidence spectra.                                                   
#G E(X),RI(X)$386.5, 387 and 388.1 are unresolved, divided intensity given
#G MR$ Deduced by the evaluators from ce data of 2007Ho20. For many       
#G transitions 2007Ho20 give pure M1 multipolarity, the evaluators deduce 
#G upper limits of mixing ratios in such cases.                           
#G CC$Theoretical values FROM BrIcc v2.3b (16-Dec-2014) 2008Ki07,
