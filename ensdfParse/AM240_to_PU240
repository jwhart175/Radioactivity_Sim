#  1972Ah07: Measured E|g, I|g, ce, (ce)(|g) coin, mass-separated source, 
#  Ge(Li) and Si(Li) detectors. Source prepared by {+237}Np(|a,n) reaction
#  at 30 MeV. Subsequent to chemical separation the source was run through
#  the Argonne isotope separator to obtain enriched {+240}Am samples.     
#  A total of 14 |g rays were reported: 42.9, 98.9 and 12 |g rays from    
#  888 to 1295 keV. In the level scheme, eight |g rays were assigned      
#  amongst five excited states. Conversion electron intensities were      
#  given in percent per {+240}Am decay, but no uncertainties were         
#  quoted in these intensities and the procedure to normalize ce          
#  intensities to |g-ray intensities was not explained.                   
#  1971LeZO: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, ce, chemically separated source,    
#  Ge(Li) detectors singles and Compton-suppressed, Si(Li) electron       
#  spectrometer, (x ray)|g coin using two NaI(Tl) detectors. A total      
#  of 31 |g rays and two conversion lines (for 42.9|g and 99.0|g)         
#  reported. Full experimental details about normalization of             
#  electron spectra and spectral (|g and ce) figures are not available    
#  in this report.                                                        
#  Therefore the evaluators have considered the |g-ray intensities        
#  reported in 1972Ah07 and 1971LeZO to be relative values given          
#  on an approximate absolute scale because their uncertainties do not    
#  include the cancellation effects from the decay-scheme normalization   
#  procedure. See comments on "I|g normalization." Despite the scarcity of
#  detailed information the agreement of |g-ray data given in 1972Ah07 and
#  1971LeZO is very good, especially for the intense 988- and 889-keV     
#  |g rays.                                                               
#  1972PoZS: Measured E|g, I|g, half-life, chemically separated source    
#  prepared by {+237}Np(|a,n) reaction at 50 MeV. Ge(Li) detector used.   
#  A total of 23 |g rays reported between 305 and 1296 keV. Small         
#  impurities of {+140}La, {+143}Ce and {+239}Am were present in the      
#  source. Twenty |g rays were placed in a level scheme essentially       
#  based on the one from 1971LeZO. No uncertainties were quoted on        
#  |g-ray intensities, except for the ratio I|g(889|g)/I|g(988|g).

#G values from 1972PoZS are not considered in deducing recommended        
#G values since the energies seem consistently higher (by up to 1 keV     
#G at the highest energies) and the intensities are given without
