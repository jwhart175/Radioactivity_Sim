#  2007Do17: Fragmentation reaction used to produce {+52}Ni isotope,      
#  primary beam: {+58}Ni{+26+} at 74.5 MeV/nucleon; target=natural Ni.    
#  Fragment separator=ALPHA-LISE3. Fragment identification by energy      
#  loss, residual energy and time-of-flight measurements using two        
#  micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors and Si detectors. Double-sided     
#  silicon-strip detectors (DSSSD) and a thick Si(Li) detector were       
#  used to detect implanted events, charged particles and |b particles.   
#  |g rays were detected by four Ge detectors. Coincidences measured      
#  between charged particles and |g rays. T{-1/2} measured by time        
#  correlation of implantation events due to {+52}Ni and subsequent       
#  emission of protons and |g rays. A partil decay scheme of 52Ni was     
#  established.                                                           
#  2013Su07: produced by Ni({+58}Ni,X), E({+58}Ni)=68.6 MeV/nucleon,      
#  natural Ni target: 147 |mg/cm{+2}. Measured |b-delayed protons,        
#  (proton)|g-coin, E|g, I|g, time-of-flight, energy loss, T{-1/2} using  
#  two plastic scintillator films, a thick silicon detector,              
#  a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSSD) and five segmented       
#  clover detectors. Performed nucleosynthesis calculations of rapid      
#  proton-capture process in an x-ray burst.                              
#  1994Fa06: source produced by Ni({+58}Ni,X), E=68 MeV/nucleon, thick    
#  natural nickel target, mass separation at GANIL. Implanted the {+52}Ni 
#  in a silicon detector (150 |mm) in a microstrip gas counter.           
#  Measured the half-life of {+52}Ni and the energies of |b-delayed       
#  protons emitted during the decay of {+52}Ni. Two proton lines have     
#  been observed at E(p)=1060 {I50} and 1340 {I60} keV with branching     
#  ratios of 0.06 {I1} and 0.11 {I1}, respectively. Analyzed origin of    
#  the two proton peaks: The proton line at 1340 keV is attributed to     
#  two decays from an IAS (0+, ispin=2, mass excess=-31516 keV) and a 1+  
#  level (22 keV below the IAS) of {+52}Co to the ground state of         
#  {+51}Fe,respectively. The proton line at 1060 keV is also explained    
#  by twodecays from the IAS to the first excited state in {+51}Fe and    
#  other 1+ level (294 keV below the IAS) in {+52}Co to the ground state  
#  of {+51}Fe, respectively. The IAS and two 1+ levels in {+52}Co are     
#  populated from the ground state of {+52}Ni.                            
#  All data are from 2007DO17, except as noted.
