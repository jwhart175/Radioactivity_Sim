#  1997GR09: total absorption |g spectrometer (^TAGS) (NaI(Tl) well       
#  detector with Si electron detector in well) operated in singles        
#  or in 4|p|g-|b coin mode, summed-EG resolution AP 5%; deduced |b       
#  feeding to (GS + 94 level) (from 4|p|g-|b coin data), |b feeding       
#  to excited states (from summed-EG spectrum); see also 1996GR20.        
#  1976GL02: on-line separation of fission products. GE(LI) detectors,    
#  FWHM=2.5 KEV at 1332 KEV. GE(LI) low-energy photon                     
#  spectrometer, FWHM=0.5 KEV at 122 KEV.                                 
#  Measured EG, RI, GG, G(T).                                             
#  The decay scheme is that of 1976GL02 with the omission of              
#  a 5289 level deexcited by 3224.4G and 3346.2G. ^TAGS data              
#  indicate that the intensities of the latter gammas are far             
#  too great for those placements to be correct. Note that the            
#  latter data also indicate AP 10.8% |b- feeding to as yet               
#  unknown levels (primarily in the energy ranges of 2.9-4.1              
#  MEV and 4.6-5.5 MEV); since the total unplaced IG is AP 2.6%,          
#  this suggests that some of the gammas in the adopted scheme            
#  are incorrectly placed.                                                
#B           B-decay strength function measured by 1975AL11.              
#B           Average EB: 1560 30 (1990RU05), 1360 70 (1982AL01).          
#B E         Based on Q-=5907 9 (2012WA38). Q- values deduced from        
#B measured B- endpoint energies are as follows: 5860 10                  
#B (1992PR03), 5850 20 (1983IA02), 5857 8 (1980DE02), 5760 40 (1978WO15;  
#B revision of 5680 40 from BG coin (6 gates) in 1973CL02). OTHER Q-:     
#B 5880 50 (2001KO07); 2006HAZZ (VALUE UNSTATED).                         
#B IB        From intensity balance at each level, except as noted;       
#B for uncertainly placed lines, the full measured IG is assumed.         
#B %IB values deduced from ^TAGS data are given in comments for           
#B comparison; for most established levels these |b feedings agree well,  
#B the notable exceptions being for the 439 and 1482 levels, and probably 
#B the 93 level. Note that ^TAGS data also indicate a total %IB=10.8 to   
#B currently unknown levels.                                              
#B IB(F)     From ^TAGS (1997GR09); may represent feeding to one level or 
#B to several levels of undetermined energy, lying within a typically     
#B AP 100 KEV wide energy bin centered on the level energy indicated.     
#B IB(H)     1976GL02 deduce IB=5 5 based on relative IG for 91KR and 91RB
#B decay chain activities in decay equilibrium with 91SR growing in,      
#B assuming %IB(91Y GS)=30.8; the evaluator revises this to IB=2 5        
#B based on adopted %IB(91Y GS)=28.6. Other %IB(GS): <6 from direct       
#B measurement (dependent on assumed |b counter threshold energy)         
#B (1976WO05); 1997GR09 estimate that, of their measured IB(GS+94)=17.4   
#B 39, IB AP 6.2 feeds the g.s. IB(GS)=60 10 (1974AC01) appears to be     
#B erroneous.
