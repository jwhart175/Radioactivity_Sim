#  1999BU32: Measured E|g, |g|g, I|g, |g|g(|q), using Gammasphere array   
#  of 36 and 72 Ge detectors and one x-ray detector.                      
#  The level scheme is as given by 1999BU32 based on |g|g,|g|g(|q) and    
#  band assignments.                                                      
#  1995HAZZ: 252CF(SF). Measured prompt G-rays emitted by fission         
#  fragments. Their level scheme show GS band, the band based on 5-,      
#  and partly the gamma band.                                             
#  1990DUZW: 232TH(18O,XNG). Measured prompt G-rays emitted by fission    
#  fragments from 246CF fissioning system.                                
#  They have shown only the GS band until the 12+                         
#  1970CH11, 1974JAZN: 252CF(SF).                                         
#  Measured: XK, G, G(T), T1/2, recoil-distance DOPPLER shift (1974JAZN). 
#  A and Z identification from multiparameter coincidences                
#  The identification is based on gating on 2+ - 0+ known transitions     
#  and on the fact that complementary fragments are in coin (CD,Sn)
