#  This decay is important from the point-of-view of superallowed         
#  (0+ to 0+) |b transition from {+38}Ca g.s. to 130.4, 0+ isomer         
#  in {+38}K. Precise half-life measurement of {+38}Ca has recently       
#  (2007Ge07) been remeasured and the analysis is in progress.            
#  The |b{++}+|e feeding is not known experimentally, it is only          
#  deduced from averaged {Ift} value for 12 other well-established        
#  superallowed |b transitions in other nuclides.
