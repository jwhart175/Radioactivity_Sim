#  |b-decay events selected using position and time correlations          
#  between implantation and |b-ray events. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g,

#G $The |g rays at 140 and 169 keV are assigned to the decay of {+105}Y;  
#G the 140|g is most likely the ground-state transition in {+104}Zr,      
#G populated here from delayed neutron decay of {+105}Y
