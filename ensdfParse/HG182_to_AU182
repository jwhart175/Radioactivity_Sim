#  2001Ib02: measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, ce, ce(|g)-coin, |g|g(t),           
#  (ce)(|g)(t) using a Si(Li) electron detector, a coaxial HPGe detector, 
#  a planar HPGe X-ray detector and a large Ge detector.                  
#  Others: 1974Ca28, 1970FiZZ. All the ten |g rays from 103.5 to          
#  542.9 keV reported by 1974Ca28 are confirmed by 2001Ib02               
#  {+182}Hg |a decay has been studied by 1993Wa03 and three |a groups     
#  deexciting to g.s.; 171, 2+ and 422, 0+ levels in {+178}Pt are         
#  reported at 5867 {I5}, 5689 {I7}, 5446 {I7}                            
#E TI,LOGFT$The values given here are considered by the evaluators as     
#E apparent |e+|b{++} feedings due to a large energy gap of about 4 MeV   
#E between the Q(|e) value and the uppermost known level at 543. The      
#E associated log| {Ift} values should be considered as approximate. The  
#E |e+|b{++} feedings quoted by 2001Ib02 in their table 2 are             
#E consistently higher than the values given here since 2001Ib02 did not  
#E take into account the 15% |a decay branch of {+182}Hg decay
