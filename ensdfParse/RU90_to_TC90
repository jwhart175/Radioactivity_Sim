#  ADDED BR TO N RECORD (TWB. 19990323)                                   
#  Production: {+58}Ni({+35}Cl,2np)                                       
#  E(35CL)=112-132 MeV. Enriched target.                                  
#  Si(Li), Compton-suppressed high-purity Ge and neutron detectors. Wheel 
#  transportation system.                                                 
#  Measured SIGMA(E(58NI),EG) and G(t).                                   
#  Identification as 90RU decay is from comparison                        
#  of SIGMA(E(58NI)) with cascade calculations, in-beam G-ray             
#  spectroscopy and x-ray detection (1991Zh29,1994Zh26).                  
#G E         Measured in coincidence with TC XKA (1994Zh26).              
#G           The strongest G rays at 154.6-, 295.4-, 319.4-, 336.5-, and  
#G 491.8 KEV were detected in coincidence with the 511-KEV annihilation   
#G radiation from the B+ decay of 90RU (1994Zh26).
