#  1993Po19: 156EU from neutron irradiation of natural Eu. Measured       
#   relative intensities of 9 |g rays. Estimated half-life of {+156}Eu.   
#  From (N,G) data, 1995GrZY reanalyze existing 156EU B- decay data and   
#   place some previously unplaced |g's, leading to the introduction of   
#   several new levels into the level scheme. These proposals are         
#   generally adopted here, although those levels which are not expected  
#   to be directly populated by |b{+-} transitions because of JPI         
#   considerations are shown as questionable.                             
#B E         In all three available studies (1962Ew01,1963Th02,1964Pe17), 
#B  the measured |b{+-} spectrum has been decomposed into three or four   
#B  components of approximately the same energy. For the branches to the  
#B  excited states, the average endpoint energies are 1195 {I20},         
#B  485 {I20}, and 300 {I30} keV. Each of these components populates      
#B  several levels in this decay scheme.                                  
#B IB        The value for the ground state is from decomposition of the  
#B  measured beta spectrum. Values for the excited levels are from        
#B  |g-intensity balances and are, therefore, limited by the              
#B  incompleteness of the decay scheme. There are unplaced |g's with      
#B  I|g up to 0.08%, so I(|b{+-}) values less than this are omitted.      
#B  Also, computed I(|b{+-}) of 1% {I5} and 0.13% {I5} to the first two   
#B  excited levels are omitted, since the assigned J|p's argue against    
#B  any significant feeding of these levels.                              
#B IB        From the decomposition of the measured beta spectrum         
#B  (1962Ew01,1963Th02,1964Pe17), the average beta feedings are 12% {I3}, 
#B  35% {I3}, and 21% {I3} for components to groups of levels             
#B  near 1250, 1960, and 2150 keV. These values agree with those from     
#B  the |g-intensity balances.                                            
#B E         The spectral shape factor for the 0+ to 0+ beta decay to the 
#B  ground state has been measured (1967Va23). The matrix elements for the
#B  beta decay to the 0+ levels at 0 and 1049 keV have been calculated    
#B  from theory. From experimental data, the matrix elements to three 0+  
#B  levels have been deduced (1969Ni11).
