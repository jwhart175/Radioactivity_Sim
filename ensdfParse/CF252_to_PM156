#  NEW DATA SET PREPARED (AUGUST, 2011) BY CW REICH                       
#  Unless noted otherwise, all the data listed here are from 2009Hw03.    
#  Excited states populated in deexcitation of highly excited fragments   
#   from the spontaneous fission of a 62-|mCi source of 252CF. Radiation  
#   studied using the Gammasphere array at ^ANL with 101                  
#   Compton-suppressed HPGe detectors. Data obtained as a part of a       
#   study of excited states in {+91,92,93}Rb. Measured EG, |g|g|g,        
#   (Pm x-ray)|g|g coin, cross coincidences between Rb and Pm. Report     
#   5 excited states with connecting |g's in 156PM but no RI values,      
#   owing to experimental difficulties.                                   
#  The evaluator has assumed that the band structure is based on the      
#   156PM g.s., for which JPI=4(+).                                       
#  Properties of this band have been discussed by 2011So14.               
#L E         From a least-squares fit by the evaluator to the listed EG   
#L  values.                                                               
#L J         Values assigned by the evaluator assuming that the levels    
#L  form a rotational-band sequence based on the 156PM g.s.               
#L BAND(A)   Assumed K=4 (g.s.) band.
