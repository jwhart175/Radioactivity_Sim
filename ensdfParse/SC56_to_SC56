#  2010Cr02: E=130 MeV/nucleon; measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, and half-lives   
#  using 16 detectors from the Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA) and BCS   
#  detectors at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). 
#  E=130 MeV/nucleon {+76}Ge{+30+} beam provided by the K500 and K1200    
#  cyclotrons at NSCL at Michigan State University. Isotopes separated    
#  with A1900 fragment separator. Time-of-flight technique. Fully stripped
#  secondary fragments were sent to NSCL Beta Counting System (BCS).      
#  System of three Si PIN detectors, a double-sided silicon strip detector
#  and six single sided silicon strip detectors. Detected |g rays using   
#  16 Ge detectors of the Segmented Germanium array. Measured half-life of
#  {+56m}Sc by fitting the (implant correlated) isomeric transition decay 
#  curve to a single exponential function with a constant background      
#  2004Li75: {+9}Be({+86}Kr{+34+},X) E=140 MeV/nucleon.  Measured E|g,    
#  I|g using a double-sided Si microstrip detector (DSSD) and the MSU     
#  segmented Germanium Array (SeGA).  Identity of particle from energy    
#  loss and time of flight from a PIN detector, the NSCL |b calorimeter,  
#  and scintillator.  The SeGA array was arranged around the |b counting  
#  system and comprised six Ge detectors, A1900 fragment separator.       
#G $ Assignment of observed transitions to feed the 26-ms g.s. was        
#G determined in 2010Cr02 from a half-life curve of |b-decay events       
#G correlated with the {+56}Sc implants as well as with one of the five   
#G prompt |g rays from the decay of the 290-ns isomer. Deduced half-life  
#G was 30 ms {I5} in agreement with the half-life of lower-spin {+56}Sc   
#G state.                                                                 
#L E$ From least-squares fit to the E|g's
