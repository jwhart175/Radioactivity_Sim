#  DATA SET UPDATED (FEBRUARY, 2007) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE REVISED QP    
#   VALUE, RECALCULATED ICC VALUES, REVISED COMMENTS                      
#  1988Vi02: Produced by Mo({+64}Zn,x) with E=285 MeV.                    
#       The studies were done on-line at the OASIS facility. The          
#       products were mass-separated and the A=154 mass fraction was      
#       transported to a counting area, collected on a tape and           
#       transported (within 65 ms) for spectroscopic study. A |DE-E       
#       particle telescope and a variety of Ge detectors were used to     
#       record coincidences. In addition, |g singles, |g(t), K x-ray      
#       and annihilation radiation were measured.                         
#  Data are from 1988Vi02, unless otherwise noted. Others: 1984HaZD,      
#       1981Ho10.                                                         
#  |a emission following this |e decay has been reported from levels      
#       between 3 and 6 MeV with I{-|a}=0.03% (1988Vi02). Similarly,      
#       proton emission has been reported from levels between 6.5 and     
#       9 MeV, with I{-p}=0.06% (1988Vi02).                               
#  Since Q(|e) |? 10 MeV and only a few |g's are reported and placed,     
#       the proposed decay scheme is clearly incomplete. Thus, it is      
#       not possible to quote reliable intensities for the |e+|b+         
#       transitions from these data.                                      
#  Experimental methods:                                                  
#  1981Ho10:  Produced by bombardment of targets with {+58}Ni or          
#       {+107}Ag ions with energies of 4.4-5.9 MeV/mass unit. Products    
#       separated in velocity selector and |a measured with Si detector.  
#       {+154}Lu identified by growth and decay characteristic of         
#       its daughter.                                                     
#  1984HaZD:  Produced by bombardment of targets of {+96}Mo and           
#       {+96}Ru with 250-260 MeV {+58}Ni and {+60}Ni ions. |g and X       
#       rays measured with Ge detectors.  Q values were determined        
#       from Kx/|b+ ratios.                                               
#E TI        1988Vi02 show these values as upper limits only, since the   
#E      decay scheme is only fragmentary and, as a result, much of the    
#E      strength of the observed deexciting |g's may be from the          
#E      feeding of their parent levels by the |g decay of higher-lying,   
#E      but unreported, excited states.                                   
#E TI(D)     1988Vi02 report significant |e+|b+ feeding from {+154}Lu     
#E      to these two levels and from this conclude that J|p for the       
#E      {+154}Lu parent is (7+). They also indicate that this |e+|b+      
#E      feeding pattern suggests a similar structure for these two final  
#E      states. The odd proton and odd neutron in the {+154}Lu parent     
#E      state are in the |p h{-11/2} and |n f{-7/2} orbitals,             
#E      respectively. The implied low log{Ift} values indicate strong     
#E      Gamow-Teller transitions, which in this case would be             
#E      |p h{-11/2}|)|n h{-9/2}. It is now believed, however, that        
#E      the configurations of the two {+154}Yb final states are quite     
#E      different (see the discussion in the {+106}Cd({+54}Fe,|a2p|g)     
#E      data set, as well as those in the original studies (1993Zh10      
#E      and 1996Zh09)). Only one of these states, the (8+) level, can     
#E      be fed by a strong Gamow-Teller transition. The transition to     
#E      the (6+) level would be |p h{-11/2}|) |n f{-7/2}. It will be      
#E      much weaker (and, possibly, may not take place).
