#  {+178}Ir activity produced by {+164}Er({+19}^F,5n), E=110 MeV. Measured
#  E|g, I|g, |g|g coin, |g|g(|q), G-ce coin, Ice. Detectors: ^CAESAR      
#  array of six Compton-suppressed HPGe detectors.                        
#  Superconducting solenoid electron spectrometer. Determined angular     
#  correlation and conversion coefficients. Deduced |g-ray                
#  multipolarities and level spins and parities.                          
#G           No absolute intensity normalization is provided because the  
#G |e decay to the g.s. is unknown, and because the 1994Ki01 authors      
#G restricted their study to |g-ray data relevant to the g.s., quasi-|b,  
#G quasi-|g, and odd-parity octupole states. Their experimental           
#G |? 2 MeV |g-ray energy cutoff could miss a significant fraction of     
#G the |e decay intensity.                                                
#G M(F)      Multipolarity assumed by the evaluators based on the J|p

#G E         Uncertainties estimated by evaluators, based on the average
