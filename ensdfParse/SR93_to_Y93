#  The adopted decay scheme is based on that of 1977Bi01 and, for         
#  E(level)<2850, it is supported by extensive coin information. The      
#  schemes proposed by 1977Bi01 and 1972He41 are in excellent agreement;  
#  schemes from 1977Bi01 and 1974Ac04 have nothing in common for          
#  E(level)>2900, but are reasonably consistent for lower E(level).       
#  The evaluator has relocated the 776G and placed the 1786G,             
#  based on level energy differences. The level proposed by 1977Bi01 at   
#  4263.67 15 KEV (IB=0.49% 5, EG=1609.8, 1899.5, 2172.0, 2985.7) has an  
#  energy exceeding Q- in 2003AU03, and that at 4119.68 23 (IB=0.14% 2,   
#  EG=2983.5, 2811.3, 2472.7) has an energy so close to Q- that LOGFT     
#  would be unrealistically low; the evaluator assumes that the associated
#  gammas are misplaced in 1977Bi01. The total unplaced IG is then AP     
#  2.1%. Placement of the 2688G is now shown as tentative (see comment on 
#  that transition).                                                      
#  Some further modification of the decay scheme of 1977Bi01              
#  is required in order to obtain consistency with the total absorption   
#  G spectrometer (^TAGS) data of 1997GR09. Specifically,                 
#  the ^TAGS data indicate that:                                          
#  (i) the 590 level is fed by a branch of AP 2%; (ii) there is AP 1.5%   
#  feeding of an unknown level (or levels) near 2200 KEV; (iii) the       
#  present level scheme significantly overestimates feeding to levels     
#  having E>3800; (iv) significant feeding (AP 2.0%) exists to levels with
#  E=3200-3800, none of which is present in the level scheme of 1977Bi01. 
#  The evaluator is unable to devise a unique set of new levels           
#  deexcited by presently unplaced gammas which would remove the above    
#  inconsistencies. However, levels with E>3800 (and their deexciting     
#  gammas) are now indicated as tentative since the ^TAGS data            
#  imply negligible feeding to E>3800 levels. NOTE THAT THE ADOPTED       
#  DECAY SCHEME IMPLIES A TOTAL ENERGY DEPOSIT OF 4290 80 cf. 4140 12     
#  FROM Q|xBR.

#B IB        From TI intensity balance, except as noted. Independent IB   
#B values (uncertainty unstated) are available, as a function of

#B of 1997Gr09, and these are given in comments; agreement is,            
#B in general, good, with several noted exceptions.

#B from difference between direct B- spectrum and B- spectrum gated by    
#B EG>50 KEV. IB(GS) AP 4.5% from multi-branch fit to total B- spectrum   
#B (1983Ia02); however, branches to other levels included in fit do not   
#B agree well with decay scheme adopted here. THE EVALUATOR ADOPTS        
#B IB(GS) LE 4.5.                                                         
#B IB(E)     IB(GS+759)=5.8% 14 from 4|p|g-|b coin (1996Gr20). Combining

#B |g-intensity balance, IB(759)=7.3% 24 is obtained; EVEN IF ALL THE     
#B UNPLACED IG FED THE 759 LEVEL (WHICH SEEMS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY) IB(759) 
#B WOULD BE 5.1% 24, FURTHER SUPPORTING 1974SC39's                        
#B ESTIMATE OF LITTLE, IF ANY, B FEEDING TO G.S. NOTE THAT LOGFT>11.0,

#B VALUE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE WITH OBSERVED TI IMBALANCE.       
#B IB(J)     From ^TAGS data (1997Gr09); may represent feeding to one     
#B level or to several levels of undetermined energy, lying within an

#B indicated.                                                             
#G           EG for several placed G rays deviates significantly from     
#G the least-squares adjusted value; this may indicate the existence of   
#G doublets.                                                              
#G           1977Bi01 observe more than twice as many G rays as 1972He41  
#G or 1974Ac04 and resolve nine multiplets reported as single lines in    
#G prior studies. The evaluator, therefore, omits G rays reported         
#G by 1974Ac04 alone (EG=814.64, 843.93, 935.11, 1006.2, 1803.7, 2196.1,  
#G 2359.5, 3414.2, 3972.9).                                               
#G           <E{-|g}>=1760 70 (1990Ru05) cf.

#G M,MR      From EKC.                                                    
#G E,RI      From 1977Bi01, except as noted. In general, data from        
#G 1974Ac04 and 1972He41 agree well with those from 1977Bi01.             
#G E(A),RI(A)$Also observed in studies other than that of 1977Bi01.       
#G E(F)      Placed by evaluator based on level energy difference.        
#G 1977Bi01 either left G unplaced or placed it such that EG was 4|s from 
#G least-squares adjusted level energy difference.                        
#G E(G)      Differs by 3|s or 4|s from least-squares adjusted level      
#G energy difference.                                                     
#G E(H)      Placed by 1977Bi01 from 2688 level, but EG is 5|s from       
#G least-squares adjusted value. EG is correct for placement from 3825    
#G level of 1977Bi01, but such a placement would imply IB(1136 level)=0.5 
#G 5 (cf. 2.6 5 based on authors' placement of 2688G, and 1.9 from ^TAGS  
#G data (1997Gr09)); more importantly, the ^TAGS data of 1997Gr09 question
#G the existence of a 3825 level and definitely rule out such strong |b   
#G feeding to it as the level scheme of 1977Bi01 implies. Since 1978St02  
#G report 2875B-260G coin (further supporting |b feeding of the 1136      
#G level) and no G-2688G coin is observed (1977Bi01,                      
#G 1974Ac04), the evaluator tentatively adopts the placement proposed in  
#G 1977Bi01. However, the 2688G may well be a doublet. The other component
#G could feed the long-lived 759 level, consistent both with the absence  
#G of G-2688G coin and with the B- branching implied by ^TAGS data        
#G (1997Gr09) for the 759, 2688 levels and in the vicinity of 3400 KEV    
#G 100; unfortunately, no other transition(s) from the implied 3447 level 
#G can be identified. Alternatively, a close doublet of 2688 levels could 
#G exist.                                                                 
#L E         From least-squares fit to EG, omitting 2688G                 
#L (5|s from expected value), 910G, 1122G (4|s from expected EG) and      
#L 1104G, 927G (3|s from expected EG).                                    
#L Based on the ^TAGS data of 1997Gr09, additional levels with E AP 2200  
#L and 3200-3800 KEV are fed in this decay, but the summed-EG resolution  
#L was inadequate to determine specific level energy values, and their    
#L deexcitation gammas are unknown. These levels are designated here      
#L by the centroid energy for AP 100 KEV wide energy bins within which    
#L at least one level lies, for the purpose of indicating the BETA        
#L strength feeding them.                                                 
#L J,T       From Adopted Levels.                                         
#L E(I)      Not a discrete level. The energy indicated here is the       
#L centroid of an energy bin of                                           
#L typically AP 100 KEV width which encompasses a level or levels fed     
#L in B- decay with the summed IB indicated; from total absorption        
#L |g spectroscopy (1997Gr09). Neither specific level energies nor        
#L deexcitation |g energies are presently known.
