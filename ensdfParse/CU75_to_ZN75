#  2011Il01: {+75}Cu beam produced from fission of {+238}U                
#  with protons at Holifield Radioactive Ion beam facility. Mass          
#  and isobaric separation of the beam with a high-resolution system.     
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g and |b|g coin, isotopic half-life using four   
#  HPGe Clover Ge detectors for |g rays and two plastic scintillators for 
#  |b particles. Level scheme deduced from detailed |g|g coin data        
#B IB$ 2011Il01 list only strong |b feedings to 345, 420, 476, 725, 1144, 
#B and 2906 levels. Others are deduced by the evaluators. These feedings  
#B should be considered as apparent values since about 35% |b feeding     
#B remains unaccounted. Note that |g rays with uncertain placements are   
#B not included by the evaluators in obtaining intensity balances         
#B LOGFT$ Deduced by the evaluators using LOGFT code. Due to incomplete   
#B decay scheme, these values should be considered as approximate, thus   
#B no uncertainties are listed here                                       
#B IB(A)$ 1.8 {I4} in 2011Il01                                            
#B IB(B)$ 7.9 {I17} in 2011Il01 for feeding to 2904.6+2906.5 levels       
#G RI$ Uncertainties quoted in 2011Il01 are statistical only, as          
#G communicated to the evaluators by the first author in an e-mail reply. 
#G The evaluators have assigned minimum of 1% uncertainty to take into    
#G account systematic uncertainties arising from efficiency calibration   
#G and peak fitting procedures                                            
#G TI(D)$ From intensity balance at 152 level. There may be direct |b     
#G feeding also which is not taken into account (evaluators' comment)     
#G E(E)$ Poor fit, level-energy difference=1754.5                         
#G RI(F)$ Uncertainty quoted as 0.6 in 2011Il01 seems a misprint. The     
#G evaluators assign 0.06                                                 
#L E$ From least-squares fit to E|g data. Reduced |h{+2}=1.0              
#L E(X)$ Two levels at 2904.7 and 2906.5 are proposed by the evaluators   
#L based on |g-ray fits in the level scheme, and agreed upon by the       
#L first author of 2011Il01 in an e-mail reply                            
#L J$ From Adopted Levels. Assignments proposed in 2011Il01 based on |b   
#L feedings and |g-decay pattern are listed under comments
