#  {+154}Pr produced by isotope separation of products from               
#       neutron-induced fission of {+235}U. The authors of 1988Ka16       
#       are coauthors of 1996To05.                                        
#  Since the Q value is over 7 MeV and only a few levels are              
#       reported, this scheme is very incomplete and, therefore, no       
#       I(|b-) values are given. Limits for such values are given         
#       by 1996To05.

#G RI        From weighted average of values of 1988Ka16 and 1996To05,    
#G      except where a large discrepancy is noted. Since                  
#G      the uncertainties in the later paper are significantly larger     
#G      than those in earlier paper, the values adopted here are very     
#G      similar to those in 1988Ka16.
