#  2011As03: {+255}No produced by the {+248}Cm({+12}C,5n) reaction with   
#  E({+12}C)=77 MeV from the 20-MeV tandem accelerator at Japan Atomic    
#  Energy Agency (JAEA). Reaction products were thermalized in He gas and 
#  deposited onto a polyethylene terephthalate. Two Si PIN photodiode     
#  detectors for detecting |a-particles (6 for |a fine structure          
#  measurements) and two Ge detectors behind the Si detectors for         
#  detecting |g rays. Measured E|g, I|g, |a|g-coin, |a|g|g-coin, |a fine  
#  structure. Deduced levels, J, |p, T{-1/2}.

#  2006He20: {+255}No produced in the following reactions:                
#  {+208}Pb({+48}Ca,n)  E=4.45 MeV/nucleon; {+238}U({+22}Ne,5n)           
#  E=5.2 MeV/nucleon; {+209}Bi({+48}Ca,2n){+255}Lr E=4.55 MeV/nucleon,    
#  followed by |e decay to {+255}No. Residues separated by SHIP velocity  
#  filter and implanted into PIPS (stop) detector at GSI facility.        
#  Measured |a, |g, |g|g coin, |a|g coin. Alpha particles measured with   
#  a PIPS detector, |g rays measured with a 'Clover' detector consisting  
#  of four Ge crystals. Prompt and delayed |a|g, |a|g|g coin.             
#  Main contaminant: {+254}No.

#A IA$ Intensities are per 100 |a decays of {+255}No. The                 
#A evaluators have multiplied the relative |a intensities                 
#A by a factor of 0.297, deduced in 2011As03 from the analysis of         
#A the {+255}No decay chain.                                              
#A HF        Calculated by evaluators using R0=1.4708, average of         
#A R0(250FM)=1.465 7 and R0(252FM)=1.4765 (19) (1998Ak04).

#L E$From a least-squares fit to gamma-ray energies                       
#L E(A)$ Level energy deduced from relative energies of the E|a from      
#L the excited state and E|a to the g.s. It should be noted that          
#L difference in the relative |a energies in the spectrum is known        
#L to a better precision than the difference obtained from absolute       
#L values of |a energies (priv comm from the first author Feb 7, 2011).   
#L No |g rays have been reported                                          
#L E(X)$ Intense L-x rays in coin with |a particles suggests              
#L that the level decays by highly converted low-energy |g rays.          
#L J$ As assigned in 2011As03 based on systematics of spin values in      
#L neighboring nuclides, |g-ray multipolarities, |a-decay hindrance
