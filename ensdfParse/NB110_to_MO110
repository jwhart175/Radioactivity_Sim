#  {+110}Nb nuclei were produced in a reaction involving the {+238}U beams
#  at E=345 MeV/A incident on a 3 mm thick Be target at RIKEN. A total of 
#  5.210{+4} {+110}Nb ions were produced. The reaction products were      
#  separated using the BigRIPS spectrometer and subsequently implanted on 
#  a stack of nine DSSD that were used to detect |b{+-} particles and     
#  conversion electrons. Gamma rays were detected using four              
#  Compton-suppressed Ge clover detectors placed in a close geometry      
#  around the DSSD's.
