#  2013An13: {+186}Po isotope produced and identified in                  
#  {+144}Sm({+46}Ti,4n) reaction at GSI facility. The evaporation residues
#  were separated in-flight by SHIP separator. Measured |a, |a-|g         
#  correlations, |a-|a correlations. Eight events were observed           
#  with four-|a correlated events associated with {+186}Po |a decay       
#  chain ({+186}Po -> {+182}Pb -> {+178}Hg -> {+174}Pt -> {+170}Os).
