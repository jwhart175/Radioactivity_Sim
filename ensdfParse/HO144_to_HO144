#  2006Ta08 (also 2005Ta31): {+144}Ho isotope formed by                   
#  {+92}Mo({+54}Fe,np) reaction at 225 MeV.                               
#  The recoil products were separated in mass/charge ratio by recoil-mass 
#  separator (RMS). Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, conversion electrons using   
#  two segmented Ge Clover detectors for |g rays and Si(Li) conversion    
#  electron spectrometer (BESCA) at Oak Ridge HRIBF.                      
#  No evidence has been found for a low-lying 1+ state as in other        
#  nuclides in this mass region.
