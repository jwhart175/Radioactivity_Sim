#133ND C  Since low- and high-spin states are populated in 133PM EC DECAY,       
#  Since low- and high-spin states are populated in 133PM EC DECAY,       
#  it seems likely that two parent decaying states are involved. The      
#  decay scheme cannot be normalized and it should be considered as
