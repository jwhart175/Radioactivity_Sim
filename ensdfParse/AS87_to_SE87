#  Proton beam was provided by the Oak Ridge Isochronous                  
#  Cyclotron (ORIC) at the HRIBF-ORNL facility. Target={+238}UC{-x}.      
#  Fission fragment were ionized to charge state +1 then purified using   
#  H{-2}S gas, a mass pre-separator and electromagnetic separation. The   
#  purified beams were then sent to the Low-energy Radioactive Ion Beam   
#  Spectroscopy Station (LeRIBSS) and implanted in a moving tape collector
#  (MTC). Measured E|g, I|g, E|b, |b|g-coin, half-life of {+87}As g.s.    
#  using two plastic scintillation counters and four HPGe detectors.      
#  Comparison with the gross theory of |b decay, the finite-range droplet 
#  model and the continuum quasiparticle random-phase approximation.
