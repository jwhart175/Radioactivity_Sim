#  2009Lu11: |g rays from the spontaneous fission of {+252}Cf were        
#  detected with the Gammasphere array. Measured E|g, I|g,

#  1974CLZX: measured EG, RI, G(T). On the basis of multiparameter        
#  coincidences, 1974CLZX assigned 56G to 147LA; however, 1984CH02        
#  demonstrated that 56G depopulates level in 148LA, not in 147LA
