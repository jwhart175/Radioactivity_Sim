#  2004Li75: {+56}Sc isotope produced in {+9}Be({+86}Kr{+34+},X)          
#  fragmentation reaction at E=140 MeV/nucleon; A1900 fragment separator, 
#  measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g, |b|g(t), lifetime using a double-sided  
#  Si microstrip detector (DSSD) and segmented Germanium Array (SeGA).    
#  Identification of particle from energy loss and time-of-flight from a  
#  PIN detector, the NSCL |b calorimeter, and scintillator.  The SeGA     
#  array was arranged around the |b counting system and comprised         
#  twelve Ge detectors                                                    
#  2004Li75 estimate 83% {I11} contribution from low-spin isomer and      
#  20% {I4} from the high-spin isomer, based on absolute |g-ray           
#  intensities and deduced |b feeding to the {+56}Ti g.s.                 
#  See also 2004Li12 from the same authors' group with 2004Li75.

#B IB$2004Li75 were unable to deduce apparent |b-decay branching ratios   
#B due to possible presence of a |b-delayed neutron branch following the  
#B decay of {+56}Sc.                                                      
#G RI$Absolute |g-ray intensities were deduced from the number of         
#G observed {+56}Ti |g-rays, the simulated |g-ray efficiency curve, and   
#G the number of {+56}Sc implants correlated with |b decays (2004Li75).
