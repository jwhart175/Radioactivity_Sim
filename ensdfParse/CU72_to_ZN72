#  {+72}Cu isotope produced by induced fission of a {+238}U target via a  
#  1-GeV proton beam at the CERN-ISOLDE facility.  The fission products   
#  were selectively ionized and mass separated.                           
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|b coin with four plastic scintillators     
#  for |b detection with three of them associated with the HPGe |g-ray    
#  detectors.  Almost the same data were reported in thesis by 2002VaZX.  
#  In table II, the following |g rays are from impurities as              
#  communicated by J.-C. Thomas: 145.1 {I3} (from {+72}Zn decay); 264.6   
#  {I1} (from {+75}Ge decay); 352.4 {I4} (from {+214}Pb background);      
#  386.5 {I1}, 487.6 {I1} and 619.4 {I2} (from {+71}Zn isomer decay);     
#  834.4 {I2} (from {+72}Ga decay); 1461.1 {I4} (from {+40}K              
#  background); and 3355.0 {I7} (in coin with 653|g from {+72}Cu decay,   
#  most likely a single-escape peak of 3865|g, its weak coin with 653|g   
#  is probably accidental)                                                
#  Other: 1983RU06, where 72ZN was produced by W(76GE,X) at  E=9
