#  2004Wa26: {+120}Rh were produced in the fragmentation of a 120         
#  MeV/nucleon {+136}Xe beam incident on a Be target. The resulting       
#  fragments were separated using the A1900 FRS spectrometer. The desired 
#  fragments were implanted in the NSCL |b counting system which included 
#  a double-sided Si strip detector (DSSD) to correlate implants of known 
#  Z and A with subsequent |b-decay events. Measured E|g, delayed         
#  |b gated |g rays, ({+120}Rh fragment)|g coin. See also thesis
