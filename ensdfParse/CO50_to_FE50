#  2007Do17: fragmentation reaction used to produce {+50}Ni isotope at    
#  SISSE/LISE3 facility in GANIL. Primary beam: {+58}Ni{+26+} at          
#  74.5 MeV/nucleon; target=natural Ni. Fragment separator=ALPHA-LISE3.   
#  Identification by energy loss, residual energy and time-of-flight      
#  measurements using two micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors and Si      
#  detectors. Double-sided silicon-strip detectors (DSSSD) and a thick    
#  Si(Li) detector were used to detect implanted events, charged particles
#  and |b particles. |g rays were detected by Ge detectors. Coincidences  
#  measured between charged particles, |b rays and |g rays.               
#  1996Fa09: experiment at FRS in GSI. Fragmentation reaction with {+58}Ni
#  primary beam of 650 MeV/nucleon and beryllium target. Identification by
#  tof, position information, magnetic field values and energy loss.      
#  Implantation into a Si telescope of 7 detectors. Coincidences between  
#  fragments and protons.
