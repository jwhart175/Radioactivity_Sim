#  Measured E|g, |g|g, I|g, and I|b, |b strength functions                
#  using an array of 42 Ge detectors and total absorption                 
#  spectroscopy (TAS) with a large NaI(Tl) detector.                      
#  All data are from 2003Gi06 as they are more complete than those of     
#  1995Sz01

#E TI$Deduced by evaluator from intensity balance. These feedings         
#E should be considered as approximate since there are probably           
#E many weak unobserved transitions as suggested by 2003Gi06 from the     
#E measured total absorption spectra.                                     
#E $log| {Ift} values have not been calculated since the |e+|b{++}        
#E feedings are only the apparent values and log| {Ift} values from these 
#E are not meaningful following 2003GiZX.                                 
#G E,RI$ From priv. comm. (2003GiZX) received as e-mail reply on June 26  
#G and July 8,2003 from M. Gierlik  of 2003Gi06.                          
#G Intensities are not corrected for summing effects which could amount   
#G to 5% for 100% cascades. As suggested by the total absorption          
#G spectroscopy (TAS), a large number of weak |g rays remain              
#G unobserved.                                                            
#G RI(A)$Same intensity is quoted for two components but with             
#G different uncertainties. It is not clear whether the values            
#G correspond to divided or undivided intensities.                        
#G E(B),RI(B)$The energy and intensity values are the same for            
#G the doublet, but different uncertainties are quoted. It is not clear   
#G whether the values correspond to divided or undivided intensities.     
#G $All transitions are assigned on the basis of |g|g coin data with      
#G gates on 777|g and 861|g. No direct transitions to g.s. were found     
#G beyond the first 2+ state.                                             
#L E$ Closely spaced (within less than { 2 keV} or so) levels whose       
#L energies overlap within the uncertainties are treated as one           
#L level by the evaluator, as advised in e-mail reply from M. Gierlik.    
#L It is possible that several other closely spaced levels (within        
#L { 4 keV} or so) also correspond to one level                           
#L E$ From least-squares fit to E|g's (by evaluator).                     
#L J$From adopted levels
