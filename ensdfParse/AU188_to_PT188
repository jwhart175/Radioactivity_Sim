#G M$From CE data using 266G (mult=E2) for normalization

#G level energy differences                                               
#G E(B)$Reported by 1972FI12 only. Treated here as uncertain              
#G E,RI$From 1978COYZ, unless otherwise stated. The uncertainties quoted  
#G by 1978COYZ on some of the G rays are LT 0.05 KEV. These have been     
#G increased to 0.05 KEV                                                  
#G CC$1972FI12 gave ICE(L3) for selected transitions. The                 
#G evaluator notes from the sample spectrum shown by 1972FI12 that        
#G L1, L2, and L3 lines are not resolved. Authors may have                
#G obtained L3 intensities by using a magnetic spectrograph. In           
#G a similar table given by 1972HUZL, these L3 intensities were           
#G incorrectly labeled as total L-shell intensities                       
#E           LOGFT of 7.5 (lowest known value in neighboring              
#E nuclides, 186RE, 188RE, 190AU) implies EC+B+                           
#E branch of 2.5% to g.s. This gives I(EC+B+)(first 2+ level)/            
#E I(EC+B+)(GS)=10. This ratio is 0.30 (186RE B-), 0.27 (186RE EC),       
#E 0.39 (188RE B-), 0.75 (190AU EC), 0.50 (ALAGA's rule). Unplaced        
#E GAMMA intensity in 188PT is insufficient to explain this discrepancy
