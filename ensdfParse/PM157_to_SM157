#  {+157}Pm produced by spontaneous fission of {+252}Cf (1994WiZZ) and    
#       neutron-induced fission of {+235}U (1992Sh32), both with          
#       isotope separation.  |g singles (1994WiZZ,1992Sh32) and |g|g      
#       coincidences (1994WiZZ) measured, and scheme given by 1994WiZZ.   
#B IB        The |b- intensity distribution, as a function of the         
#B      excitation energy, has been reported (1997Gr09) from total        
#B      absorption |g spectra (TAGS), independent of the placements of    
#B      |g-rays in the scheme. These results are shown, in part, as       
#B      pseudolevels with no depopulating |g rays; these levels have a    
#B      total |b- feeding of 20%. Since |g's from these levels will       
#B      populate the lower lying levels, the I{-|b-} computed from        
#B      intensity balances for known |g rays will not be accurate,        
#B      especially for the values of a few percent or less. The           
#B      energies of the pseudolevels (1997Gr09) are chosen, often         
#B      equally spaced, to represent the levels in an energy range, and   
#B      do not represent actual levels.  Where the pseudolevels are       
#B      equally spaced, this range is half of the distance to the         
#B      adjacent levels; and where a pseudolevel is between discrete      
#B      levels, the range is between these levels. log {Ift}'s are not    
#B      given for the pseudolevels since they may represent the feeding   
#B      of several actual levels.                                         
#B IB        The I|b- values to the levels which are depopulated by       
#B      |g's, are from a combination of the TAGS results and the          
#B      intensity balances.  Due to the incompleteness of the |g-ray      
#B      portion of the decay scheme, no uncertainties of given for        
#B      I{-|b-} or the log {Ift}'s.                                       
#G E,RI      From 1994WiZZ.  Other: 1992Sh32 report 30 |g's with          
#G      energy uncertainties of 0.1 to 0.3 keV and intensities which      
#G      differ from those given here by as much as a factor of 2.         
#G RI        I{-K|a} = 78 {I4} and I{-K|b} = 19.5 {I12} (1992Sh32).       
#G M         From 1994WiZZ and based on information not available to      
#G      evaluator.                                                        
#L           The lowest log {Ift} value is 5.6 which suggests (1998Si17)  
#L      that this is an allowed |b- transition; however, in a more        
#L      complete decay scheme, this value might be increased              
#L      significantly.  Since this |b- branch is to a level with          
#L      J|p=(3/2-), the log {Ift} values suggest J|p=(1/2,3/2,5/2)-       
#L      for {+157}Pm, which agrees with the (5/2-) assignment based on    
#L      the analogy with {+153}Pm (1990Ja11).                             
#L E         From least-squares fit to |g energies.                       
#L J         From 1994WiZZ and based on expected band structure and       
#L      Nilsson states. For {+159}Gd, also with N=95, the review of       
#L      1990Ja11 lists the lowest energy Nilsson states as 5/2[521] at    
#L      0 keV, 5/2[642] at 67 keV, 5/2[523] at 146 keV, 1/2[521] at 507   
#L      keV, 11/2[505] at 682 keV, and 3/2[651]+3/2[402] at 744 keV.
