#  2009St28 (also 2007To23, 2006ToZW, 2005WaZY): {+136}Xe beam of         
#  E=120 MeV/nucleon. Reaction products separated by A1900 spectrometer,  
#  and implanted in NSCL-MSU Beta Counting System, consisting of three    
#  silicon PIN detectors, one double-sided and six single-sided silicon   
#  detectors. Neutron-rich Pd and Ag isotopes identified based on         
#  time-of-flight and energy loss. Measured E|g, I|g, half-life,          
#  fragment-|g coincidence. One possible scenario of placement of the four
#  |g rays is shown, with an ambiguous ordering of the 731-672 and 717-686
#  cascades                                                               
#  2012Ka36: {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon provided by the RIBF       
#  accelerator complex at RIKEN facility. Fission fragments were separated
#  and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal plane of       
#  ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum stopper.  
#  Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method.            
#  Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers were detected by three     
#  clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, isomer       
#  half-life. Deduced levels, J, |p. Comparison with previous studies.

#G E$Weighted averaged values from 2013La11 and 2012Ka36. Some of the     
#G values given in 2006ToZW are more precise but these are in disagreement
#G with the values in 2009St28 from the same group. The energies of all   
#G the four gamma rays in 2009St28 are systematically higher by |?3 keV   
#G as compared to those in 2013La11, 2012Ka36 and 2006ToZW.               
#G RI$From 2013La11, where the values are most precisely given probably
