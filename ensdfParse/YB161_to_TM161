#  161YB produced by 660-MeV proton spallation on Ta and Hf targets,      
#  followed by isotope separation. G singles and GG(t) coincidences       
#  measured with Ge detectors. CE spectra measured using Si(Li) and       
#  magnetic spectrometers and GCE coincidences.                           
#            Because of the many unplaced |g's, the large gap between     
#   the energy of the highest reported level and the Q(|e) value, and the 
#   uncertain status of the mults of some low-energy transitions, the     
#   evaluator regards the extraction of EC decay-branch intensities from  
#   intensity-balance considerations as unreliable. Consequently, EC      
#   decay branch intensities, as well as a |g-intensity normalization,    
#   are not quoted here.                                                  
#G           All data are from 1981Ad02, unless otherwise noted; measured 
#G |g singles, |g|g(t) coincidences, ce spectra, and |gce coincidences.   
#G RI        K|a{-1}| x-ray intensity is 530 {I40} (1974Ad10).            
#G RI        Annihilation-radiation intensity is 222 {I30} (1981Ad02).    
#G M         From {+161}Tm Adopted Gammas and based on ce data from       
#G {+161}Yb decay (1981Ad02) and |g(|q) from in-beam study (1984Fo04).    
#G CC        Only a few CC and KC values are given.  More are not         
#G      justified, since the decay scheme is poorly defined.              
#L           All data are from 1981Ad02, unless otherwise noted; measured 
#L |g singles, |g|g(t) coincidences, ce spectra, and |gce coincidences.   
#L E         From least-squares fit to |g energies, except for the value  
#L assigned by the evaluator to the 7.4-keV level.                        
#L E         In 1981Ad02, energies were not determined for the 1/2[411]   
#L   band members and for the levels proposed as the bandheads of         
#L   3/2[411] and 1/2[541]. From in-beam studies (1984Fo04), the position 
#L   of the 1/2+ level was determined, so the evaluator has been able to  
#L   assign energies to these remaining levels.                           
#L E         From energy differences of 7 keV among the unplaced |g's,    
#L  levels at 722, 800, 813, and 823 keV are possible, but are not        
#L  included.                                                             
#L T         From {+161}Yb |e decay studies only. See {+161}Tm Adopted    
#L Levels for additional data for the 78-keV level.                       
#L J         From adopted values.                                         
#L           Level is 7/2(0).                                             
#L           Levels are 1/2(7), 3/2(22), 5/2(167), and 7/2(210).          
#L           Level is 5/2(18).                                            
#L           Level is 7/2(78).                                            
#L           Level is 1/2(367).                                           
#L           Proposed levels are 3/2(337) and 5/2(433).                   
#L E(R)      Value deduced by evaluator from placement of 1/2+ level at   
#L           7.4 keV.                                                     
#L E(X)      1981Ad02 tentatively placed a 140.25 G between levels        
#L assigned as the 3/2+ and 5/2+ members of the 1/2[411] band, making     
#L this G doubly placed. These authors indicated that an alternative      
#L would be to place a 144.43 G between these two levels. In light of     
#L subsequent in-beam studies, the evaluator has chosen this latter       
#L placement. This has led to the energy of this level being revised      
#L upward from that shown by 1981Ad02.
