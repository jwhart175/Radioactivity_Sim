#  2008Ma01: The {+54}Ca isotope formed by bombarding a {+9}Be target     
#  by E=140 MeV/nucleon {+76}Ge beam, A 1900 fragment separator.          
#  TOF technique. Measured |b particles using Beta Counting System of     
#  three Si PIN detectors, a double-sided silicon strip detector          
#  and six single sided silicon strip detectors. Detected |g rays using   
#  16 Ge detectors of the Segmented Germanium array. Measured half-life of
#  {+54}Ca by fitting the decay curves to a function which included       
#  decay of the parent, growth and decay of daughter and a constant       
#  background. A 247-keV gamma ray was seen in correlation with |b rays   
#  and assigned to the decay of {+54}Ca.

#  MEV/NUCLEON, TOF TECHNIQUE, measured |b particles using NSCL Beta      
#  Counting System of three Si PIN detectors, a double-sided silicon      
#  strip detector and six single sided silicon strip detectors. Detected  
#  prompt and delayed |g rays in coin with fragments using 16 Ge detectors
#  of the Segmented Germanium array.  Measured half-life of {+54}Ca by    
#  fitting the decay curves of ({+54}Ca)|b(247|g) correlated events.      
#  Decay scheme for 54CA is from 2008Ma01.
