#  2013So17: {+116}Tc isotope produced in {+9}Be({+238}U,X) reaction      
#  at 345 MeV/nucleon at RIBF-RIKEN facility. Fragments identified by     
#  Zero-degree spectrometer which analyzed events based on B|r-tof-|DE.   
#  Measured E|g, I|g, E|b, (fragment)|g-coin, |b|g-coin, |g|g-coin using  
#  Euroball-RIKEN array of 12 HPGe cluster detectors and WAS3ABi particle 
#  detector array of DSSSDs. Deduced levels, J, |p, bands. Comparison with
#  interacting Boson model calculations.                                  
#L E$From least-squares fit to E|g values                                 
#L J$From Adopted Levels, based essentially on systematics of e-e nuclei  
#L for first 2+ and 4+ states, and from comparisons with IBM-1            
#L model calculations for higher states (2013So17)
