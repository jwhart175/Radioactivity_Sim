#  2006Ch52: {+251}Md isotope produced                                    
#  in |a decay of {+255}Lr isotope. Parent nuclide produced by            
#  {+209}Bi({+48}Ca,2n) reaction, in two separate                         
#  experiments conducted at JYFL and GANIL. In both experiments, an       
#  incident beam energy of E|?217 MeV was used. Recoil products           
#  separated from the primary beam in each.                               
#  JYFL: Measured recoil products, E|a, I|a, and tof using a              
#  Multi-Wire Proportional Counter gas detector, two double-sided Si      
#  strip detectors (DSSSD) and a "box" of 28 pin-diodes surrounding the   
#  two DSSSDs.                                                            
#  GANIL: Measured recoiled products, E|g, I|g, E|a, I|a, ce, and tof     
#  using a "galotte" detector (mylar foil and micro-channel plate         
#  detector), a DSSSD, four cooled Si detectors (BEST) and four segmented 
#  Ge detectors (EXOGAM).                                                 
#  Theoretical calculations using Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) with      
#  Skyrme were performed to interpret the experimental results            
#  2005He27: {+251}Md produced from |a decay of                           
#  {+255}Lr. {+255}Lr produced by the {+209}Bi({+48}Ca,2n) reaction       
#  with beam energy E=4.55-4.65 MeV/nucleon.                              
#  Evaporation residues were separated from the primary beam by velocity  
#  filter SHIP at GSI facility. Measured (fragments)-|a coin, |a-|g coin, 
#  prompt and delayed |g-rays, and K x-rays.                              
#  |g-rays were detected with a 'Clover' detector and a position          
#  sensitive (PIPS) detector was used to measure the |a decay.            
#A $|a line at 7590 {I5} in the |a spectrum in 2006Ch52 is assigned to a  
#A sum line with an intensity of 13 {I3} relative to 87 {I3} for 7550|a.
