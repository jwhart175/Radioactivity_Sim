#  2012Hi07: {+100}Sn produced in fragmentation of {+124}Xe beam at 1.0   
#  GeV/nucleon with a 4.008 g/cm{+2} thick beryllium target at GSI        
#  facility. The FRS fragment separator was used to separate reaction     
#  products. Fragments were separated and identified event-by-event with  
#  respect to A/Q and Z based on magnetic rigidity and flight times. A    
#  total of 259 {+100}Sn nuclei were identified, much more than in any    
#  previous experiment. The ions were implanted into segmented Si strip   
#  detectors surrounded by the RISING array consisting of 105 Ge          
#  detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, E|b, I|b, {+100}Sn half-life  
#  by detecting radiations in correlation with 163 {+100}Sn nuclei stopped
#  in the implantation layer. Out of 163 {+100}Sn implanted nuclei, 126   
#  decay chains could be assigned. A tentative decay scheme with |g rays  
#  is proposed by 2012Hi07 for the first time                             
#  See Adopted Levels of {+100}Sn for identification and production       
#  of {+100}Sn in 1995Sc28 (also 1994Sc22,1995Sc33); 1995Le14 (also       
#  1994Le27, 1995Ry03), 2008Ba53                                          
#  The proposed decay scheme is tentative, except for the 1+ definite     
#  level at about 2.7 MeV. It is based on experimental observation of     
#  five gamma rays and a theoretical level scheme from large-scale        
#  shell model calculations (2012Hi07). Based on measured intensities,    
#  all five gamma rays could be placed in a single cascade with the       
#  energy of the 1+ state at about 4 MeV, but measured Q(|e)=4.31 MeV     
#  does not permit such placement, thus parallel paths are proposed       
#  All data are from 2012Hi07 unless otherwise stated
