#  ADDED MISSING N RECORD AND CORRECTED PN RECORD (TWB. 940216)           
#  DATA SET UPDATED (MAY, 2006) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE NEW QA VALUE,      
#   REVISED ALPHA-DECAY BRANCH AND ASSOCIATED COMMENTS.                   
#  The experimental methods were:                                         
#  1975To05: 166W produced by 156DY(16O,6N) reaction on enriched (12.6%)  
#  target. ALPHA spectra measured with SI surface-barrier detectors.      
#  Excitation function used to identify mass.                             
#  1979Ho10: 166W produced in 58NI bombardment of 108PD target. ALPHA     
#  spectra measured with SI detector following velocity selector.         
#  ALPHA-decay sequences used to determine mass.                          
#  1989Hi04: 166W produced in the 136BA(36AR,6n) reaction at 36AR energies
#  from 177 MEV to 214 MEV. Targets were {+136}BaF{-2} (93% enrichment),  
#  1.2 and 1.3 MG/CM2 thick, and backed with ^C foils, 30 and             
#  34 |mg/cm{+2} thick. Recoil nuclides were transported using a ^He-jet  
#  tape-transport system for analysis. |a particles were counted using    
#  450 mm{+2} surface-barrier detector. Mass assignment was determined    
#  from excitation functions. T was obtained from multiscaled spectra.    
#  See also 1975IjZZ and 1981HoZM for other reports on same results.
