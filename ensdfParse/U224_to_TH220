#  {+224}U produced using the fusion evaporation reaction                 
#  {+206}Pb({+22}Ne,4n), with 119 MeV {+22}Ne beam produced at FLNR       
#  facility (Dubna). Evaporation residue (ER) was separated using SHELS   
#  separator and then passed through a TOF system and implanted into a    
#  DSSD in front of a HPGe. Position and time-correlated |a decays were   
#  used to identify ER.                                                   
#  Measured E|a, I|a, E|g, I|g, |a|g-coin, (ER)|a-coin and T{-1/2} of     
#  {+224}U g.s.                                                           
#  Cross section with lower limit of 600 nb {I100} was obtained.
