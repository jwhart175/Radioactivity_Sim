#  1990NI05: 227NP activity was produced by 209BI(22NE,4N), E=121 MEV, and
#  identified by mass separation and by detection of ALPHA particles with 
#  EA=8010 KEV from 223PA, the daughter nucleus. No spontaneous fission   
#  activity was observed. Measured EA. Detector: semi.                    
#  1990AN19, 1994YE08: 227NP activity was produced by 209BI(22NE,4N),     
#  E=106-115 MEV, separated using the recoil separator ^VASSILISSA, and   
#  identified by detection of ALPHA particles with EA=8.00 15 MEV and     
#  EA=8.20 15 MEV from 223PA, its daughter nucleus. Measured EA.          
#  Detector: semi.                                                        
#  The 1-min spontaneous fission activity (T=60 S 5 (1966KU13), T=51 S 15 
#  (1976SOZT)), previously assigned to 228NP or 227NP, probably belongs to
#  228NP.                                                                 
#            AN ELECTRON CAPTURE DELAYED FISSION ACTIVITY WITH T=1.07 M 3 
#  HAS BEEN OBSERVED AND ASSIGNED TO 228NP ON THE BASIS OF CHEMICAL       
#  SEPARATION OF NEPTUNIUM, AND ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF DAUGHTER NUCLEI  
#  WHICH BELONG TO THE ELECTRON CAPTURE DECAY CHAIN (1990HAZY).
