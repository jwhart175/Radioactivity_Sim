#  1986Du07: 19N ions from the fragmentation of a 60 MeV/u 40AR beam on a 
#  Be target at ^GANIL were filtered by the ^LISE spectrometer and        
#  implanted in a Ge detector.                                            
#  Beta gamma coincidences of 19N were measured along with their relative 
#  intensities. T1/2=320 MS 100 was also deduced.                         
#  1988Sa04: 19N ions from the fragmentation of a 35 MeV/u 22NE beam on a 
#  Ta target at ^MSU were filtered by the ^RPMS and were implanted in a Si
#  telescope. Multiple neutron-rich isotopes were separated and identified
#  by the ^RPMS, and each of their half lives was measured. All counts    
#  above a threshold of 0.3 MEV were recorded. T1/2=235 MS 32 was         
#  deduced for 19N.                                                       
#  1988Mu08: 19N ions from the fragmentation of a 45 MEV/u 48CA beam on a 
#  181TA target at ^GANIL were filtered                                   
#  by the ^LISE spectrometer and implanted in a SI telescope.             
#  The telescope was surrounded by a thin scintillator to detect |b-rays  
#  and a segmented NE102A 4|p neutron array with an energy threshold of   
#  350 keV.                                                               
#  Following implantation of 19N in the telescope the cyclotron frequecy  
#  was scrambled and the decay event was measured.                        
#  A delayed neutron emission probability of PN=33 +34-11% was deduced.   
#  T1/2=210 MS +200-100 was also measured.                                
#  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MEV proton bombardment of a     
#  232TH target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge   
#  filter and transferred to the ^TOFI spectrometer at ^LAMPF.            
#  The |b-delayed neutron probability PN=62.4 2.6% was deduced and        
#  T1/2 = 329 MS 19  was measured.                                        
#  A reanalysis of the (1991Re02) data, with additional data              
#  was published in the International conference on nuclear data for      
#  science and technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century,     
#  Gatlinburg, ^TN (United States), 9-13 May 1994. The reanalysis         
#  indicates PN=(48.7 21)% and T1/2 = 255 MS 10.                          
#  2006Su12: 19N ions from fragmentation of an 80 MEV/u 22NE beam on a Be 
#  target were selected by the ^NSCL ^A1200 fragment separator and        
#  implanted in a plastic scintillator. An array of curved plastic        
#  scintillator bars surrounded the implantation target. The              
#  time-of-flight between the implantation detector (beta counter) and the
#  neutron detector array determined the neutron energies. Two ^HPGE      
#  detectors measured |g rays. The neutron emission probability           
#  Pn=(41.8 9)% was deduced from the neutron data. The analysis revealed  
#  eight neutron groups to 18O states. |g transitions among excited states
#  in 19O and 18O  were also observed. A detailed decay scheme is         
#  suggested by comparison of the |g transition intensities amongst the   
#  19O levels, |b-|g-n coincidences, and a reasonable placement of neutron
#  group intensties that could give an intensity balance. Neutron emission
#  groups with intensities less than 1% are left unplaced in the decay    
#  scheme. T1/2=336 MS 3 was also measured.                               
#  Comments: The measurements of 2006Su12 provide the most complete       
#  measure of 19O and 18O spectroscopy for levels and transitions involved
#  in the decay. 1986Du07 measured an additional |g ray energy            
#  of 709.2 keV not detected by 2006Su12. This nonobservation can be      
#  explained by a contaminant of 22O in the beam. 2006Su12 also expresses 
#  two possible sources of gamma decay for the 2475.2 keV transition. This
#  energy is consistent with both the 1- to 2+ transition in 18O as well  
#  as the 3/2- to 1/2+ in 19O. It was assigned to 19O; the intensity ratio
#  in 18O should have an absolute intensity ratio of 13:5 and the observed
#  intensity ratio was 1:13.
