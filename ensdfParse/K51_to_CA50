#  {+51}K isotope produced in spallation reaction by bombarding a UC{-x}  
#  target by a 1.4 GeV proton beam produced by the CERN                   
#  proton-synchrotron booster (PSB). Spallation products analyzed using   
#  the high resolution separator (HRS). Measured E|g, |g|g, |b, |bn       
#  coin, |bn|g coin, |b|g coin, and |b|g|g coin. The |g rays were         
#  detected using two large Ge clusters from the MINIBALL array. Low      
#  energy neutrons detected using six detectors each composed of a        
#  thick BC400 plastic scintillator. High energy neutrons were detected   
#  using 11 curved BC400 scintillating plastic bars from the TONNERRE     
#  array. The |b particles were detected using a cylindrical plastic      
#  scintillator.
