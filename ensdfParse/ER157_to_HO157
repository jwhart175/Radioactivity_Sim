#  The decay scheme is primarily that of 1978BrYV (a private              
#       communication) and is based on the |g data of 1977AnYX            
#       (a thesis) and some level information from the                    
#       ({+3}He,d) and (|a,t) reaction data of 1977Pa23.                  
#  This decay scheme is very tentative. There are several                 
#       inconsistencies including some between the J|p and multipolarity  
#       assignments as well as with some spin and band assignments        
#       from the reaction data of 1977Pa23. Also, the                     
#       decay scheme of 1979DzZZ, deduced from |gce coincidence data, is  
#       quite different, but the latter information is not complete       
#       enough to use here.                                               
#  For these studies, {+157}Er has been produced by the reactions         
#      Ho(p,xn), Dy({+3}He,xn), {+149}Sm({+12}C,4n),                      
#      {+141}Pr({+20}Ne,4n){+157}Tm followed by |e decay, and             
#      spallation of Ta. Some studies used chemical or isotope separation.
#      |g singles, |g|g coincidences, |gce coincidences, and              
#      and lifetimes have been measured.

#       target.  |g singles and |g|g coincidences were measured with Ge   
#       detectors.  About 100 |g's reported.  Decay scheme only includes  
#       14 |g's and has been replaced by that of 1978BrYV.                
#  1977BoYR: produced by Dy({+3}He,xn) with E({+3}He)=80 MeV followed by

#  1978BrYV: private communication from D. S. Brenner to C. W. Reich,     
#       which consisted of a decay scheme drawing.  This scheme replaces  
#       that of 1977AnYX and it includes 41 |g's.  It uses the |g data    
#       from 1977AnYX and to some extent makes use of the levels

#E TI        Values are from |g intensity balances, with uncertain        
#E      |g's omitted. Due to the tentative nature of the decay scheme,    
#E      only values over 2% and to levels above 155 keV are given.        
#E      Values for lower energy levels are not meaningful since the |g    
#E      transitions from the 91- and 177-keV have not been seen. These    
#E      calculated values are not in conflict with the |g-intensity       
#E      normalization (1984GrZL). The total ec+|b+ intensity              
#E      given is 42%.
