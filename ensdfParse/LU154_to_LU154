#  DATA SET UPDATED (FEBRUARY, 2007) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE REFERENCE TO  
#   A THEORETICAL STUDY OF E2 HINDRANCE, RECALCULATED ICC VALUES,         
#   A RECALCULATED NR VALUE, AND CHANGES TO SOME COMMENTS.                
#  This 154LU isomer was produced in the {+102}Pd({+54}Fe,pn) reaction    
#  with E(54FE)=245 MeV. The recoil-product 154LU isomer was mass-analyzed
#  in the ^Daresbury ^Recoil ^Separator and collected on an ^Al catcher   
#  foil. G singles and GG coincidences were measured using several ^Ge    
#  detectors and a ^LEPS detector.

#L           There may be some question as to whether the lowest level    
#L reported here (the (9+) level) is the same as the level that decays    
#L via EC to 154YB. In their study of the 154LU EC decay, 1988Vi02 assign 
#L the EC parent level as (7+). With this in mind, 1990Mc02 state that    
#L their results shed no light on this question, since a low-energy,      
#L highly converted transition (from (9+) to (7+)) would not have been    
#L detected in their work. However, the evaluators have concluded, based  
#L on the information from the in-beam studies (1993Zh10,1996Zh09) of the 
#L 154YB level scheme, that the JPI value of the 154LU parent in the EC   
#L decay is probably not (7+) but rather is (9+). Throughout this         
#L evaluation, it has been assumed that the (9+) level seen here is the   
#L same as the parent state of the 154LU EC decay.                        
#L E         Relative values calculated from a least-squares fit to the   
#L listed EG values. From the 158TA ALPHA decays the energy of the        
#L lower (9+) level is 59 9 keV (1997Da07).                               
#L J         The JPI values and configuration assignments are those       
#L suggested by 1990Mc02 and are based on analogy to those in 150HO and   
#L 152TM. Assignments agree with those in 154LU Adopted Levels.
