#  2004LU20: Levels of {+105}Tc were studied through the spontaneous      
#  fission of a {+252}Cf source sandwiched between two Fe foils, and      
#  placed in an 8-cm polyethylene ball.                                   
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, lifetimes with the Gammasphere array,         
#  comprised of 102 active Compton-suppressed Ge detectors.               
#  1998HW04: "GAMMASPHERE" with 72 Compton-suppressed Ge detectors

#  Analysis of transitions emitted from fission fragments prior to BETA   
#  decay. Transition half-lives are from (SF-fragment)G(T)-coin (semi);   
#  assignments from (fragment)(fragment)(XK)(G,CE) coin                   
#G E$Transition energies listed to two decimal places in 2004Lu20 for     
#G the purposes of testing sum relationships in the decay scheme and for  
#G determining signature splitting. The authors do not believe the        
#G the absolute transition energies are accurate to better than 0.1 keV.  
#G The uncertainties given here represent statistical standard deviations
