#  1981FrZY: source from {+70}Ge({+16}O,pn|g) reaction. Measured E|g, I|g,
#  |g|g, E|b from |b|g coin using Ge(Li), Si(Li) and plastic              
#  scintillators. A total of 20 |g rays reported up to 1503 keV and       
#  confirmed another seven |g rays at higher energies from |g|g data.     
#  The source prepared in heavy-ion studies contained many impurities.    
#  1970Re03: measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, E|b, ce, |g|g(|q) using Ge(Li) and  
#  NaI(Tl) detectors. A total of 60 |g rays reported. This work is        
#  the most detailed study of {+84}Y but it is a private communication,   
#  and the results have not appeared in open literature                   
#  1969Za06: measured E|g, I|g. A total of 24 |g rays reported and        
#  level scheme proposed with 11 excited states                           
#  Other measurements:                                                    
#  2000Do10: Decay of {+84}Y g.s. and isomer studied by using several     
#  gamma-ray detectors. The authors stated that 50 |g rays were           
#  observed in the decay of the high-spin isomer (assigned as g.s.        
#  by 2000Do10) as well as in the decay of 5.6-s activity, including      
#  population of a 7+ member of quasi-|g band from the decay of           
#  39.5-min activity. But details of this study are not available either  
#  in the (conference) paper or according to an e-mail                    
#  reply from the first author of this work on May 24, 2003               
#  1984Ak02: measured |g|g(|q) for four |g|g cascades using Ge(Li) and    
#  NaI(Tl) detector combination                                           
#  1981Li12: measured |b|g coin                                           
#  1976Ia01: measured E|g for three |g rays                               
#  1974PoZT: measured ce for about 12 transitions, but no data            
#  are available. This work is from the same group as 1970Re03            
#  1971Do01: measured E|g, I|g for 12 |g rays                             
#  1962Ya02: measured E|g, I|g, ce for six |g rays, T{-1/2} of {+84}Y     
#  The level scheme given here is mostly from 1970Re03 with some          
#  revisions based on in-beam |g-ray studies. The level scheme given      
#  by 1981FrZY is quite similar to the one given in 1970Re03 with some    
#  minor differences                                                      
#  The evaluators treat the level scheme as incomplete since many         
#  transitions are either unplaced or questionable. In the opinion of     
#  the evaluators there is no complete and comprehensive study of         
#  this decay in the literature                                           
#E $ From intensity balance following direct |b{++}+|e feedings           
#E treated as zero are as follows: 3 4 for 793 level, -3.8 9 for          
#E 1454 level, -1 5 for 1767 level, 0.1 8 for 2448 level, 0.8 5 for       
#E 2886 level.                                                            
#E $ NEED TO RESOLVE -3.8 9 FOR 1454 LEVEL ??                             
#E $ The |b|g coin study of 1970Re03 shows that observed |b branches      
#E are in coin with 793, 974 and 1040 |g rays implying that the           
#E 2808 keV level is the lowest level which has appreciable direct        
#E |b{++}+|e feeding. The |b branches reported by 1970Re03 are:           
#E E|b=1641 {I10} (I|b=47%); E|b=2242 {I17} (I|b=25%);                    
#E E|b=2637 {I20} (I|b=21%); E|b=3148 {I20} (I|b=7%)                      
#E $ E(B+ ENDPOINT)=4.2 MEV 1 FROM 793G(B) COIN (1981FrZY) cannot         
#E be accounted, it implies a direct feeding of 1454 level,               
#E which is inconsistent with |g intensity balance. This |b branch may    
#E be associated either with an impurity or with the decay of 4.6-s       
#E activity of 84Y                                                        
#E TI,LOGFT$ The decay scheme seems to be incomplete, thus all weak       
#E feedings and associated LOGFT values should be regarded as tentative.  
#E TI(M)$ Feeding is too large for the high degree of forbiddenness       
#E probably due to incompleteness of the decay scheme.
