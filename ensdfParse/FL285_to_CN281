#  2010El06: {+285}Fl nuclide produced in {+242}Pu({+48}Ca,5n) at         
#  E=256 MeV from LBNL cyclotron facility. Evaporation residues were      
#  separated by BGS based on magnetic rigidities. Signals from            
#  multiwire proportional counters (MWPC) and focal plane detector (FPD)  
#  were used to distinguish implantation events from radioactive decay    
#  events in the FPD. Z=114 events were identified by detecting time      
#  and position correlated events corresponding to their implantation     
#  and subsequent radioactive decay chain terminating in SF decay.

#  E=245,250 MeV at U400 cyclotron at FLNR-JINR facility.                 
#  Targets={+240}Pu enriched to 98.97% at ORNL facility, and 92%          
#  enriched at JINR facility, with average thickness of 0.39 mg/cm{+2}    
#  {I4} for mixed ORNL/JINR {+240}Pu material. Evaporation residues (ERs) 
#  were separated from the incident beam ions, scattered particles, and   
#  transfer reaction products by the DGFRS based on magnetic rigidities.  
#  Recoils passed through a tof system of two multiwire proportional      
#  counters (MWPCs), and were implanted in the DSSD detector system       
#  (0.3-mm thick double-sided silicon strip detectors) placed at the      
#  final focus of the DGFRS. Events related to Z=114 were identified by   
#  detecting time and position correlated events corresponding to their   
#  implantation and subsequent |a-decay chain terminating in SF decay.
