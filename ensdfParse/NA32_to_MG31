#G E$ Weighted averages from 2008TR04, 2007MA04, 1993KL02, 1984GU19       
#G RI$ Data are discrepant for 3 |g-rays 171, 221 and 240. The            
#G evaluators have taken un-weighted averages of relative intensities     
#G from all available data (reference I|g=100 for 885 |g in {+32}Mg). All 
#G the intensity data from the four papers are given under document       
#G records. The weighted averages do overlap the unweighted average       
#G values but in 3 cases are unacceptably high.
