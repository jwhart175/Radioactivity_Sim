#  Identification of {+34}Ne nuclide:                                     
#  2004Lu19, 2003Lu11, 2002No11, 2002Lu19, 2002Lu09: RIKEN-GANIL-Dubna    
#  collaboration. {+34}Ne confirmed in reaction: Ta({+48}Ca,X)            
#  E=58.9 MeV/nucleon. Fragmentation of {+48}Ca primary beam.             
#  Reaction fragments analyzed by RIPS recoil fragment separator          
#  at RIKEN facility and LISE-2000 spectrometer at GANIL. Isotopic        
#  identification by measurements of energy loss, total kinetic energy,   
#  time-of-flight and magnetic rigidity for each fragment. Two events     
#  were assigned to {+34}Ne nuclide in each of the two experiments:       
#  one at RIKEN and the other at GANIL. Measured |s=0.17 pb {I12} for     
#  yield of {+34}Ne in the fragmentation of {+48}Ca beam at GANIL         
#  corresponding to two events seen in (2002Lu09,2003Lu11,2004Lu19); data 
#  displayed in figure 1b in 2002Lu19 or figure 1a in 2002No11
