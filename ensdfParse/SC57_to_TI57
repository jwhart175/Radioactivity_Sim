#  2005GA01, 1999So20 (also 2003So21): {+57}Sc produced in fragmentation  
#  of {+76}Ge{+30+} beam on a {+58}Ni target. LISE3 achromatic            
#  spectrometer used to separate fragments with magnetic rigidity tuned   
#  to optimize transmission of {+62}V and {+64}Cr fragments.              
#  Transmitted nuclei were identified by three Si detectors where two     
#  served for energy loss and time-of-flight measurements while the others
#  determined their residual energies.                                    
#  Measured E|g, I|g, I|b, |g|g, |b|g coin, |g(t), lifetimes with four Ge 
#  detectors placed around a thick Si telescope.  Half-lives determined by
#  fitting procedure involving five parameters: half-lives of mother,     
#  daughter and grand-daughter nuclei, the |b-efficiency and the          
#  background rate over the 1 s collecting time.
