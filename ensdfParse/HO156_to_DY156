#   Report 22 G's in scheme and 28 unplaced; no RI.                       
#  There is also a thesis by Koldewijn, 1977, Univ. of Amsterdam.         
#E E         From experimental E|b+ (1976Gr20). 2002KaZR also report      
#E  positron branches having end-point energies of 680 10 and 1540 30,    
#E  with relative intensities of 0.08 and 1, respectively.                
#E           With a Q(|e) value of AP 5 MeV and no levels reported        
#E  above 3 MeV, it is likely that the decay scheme is incomplete. Thus,  
#E  beta-transition intensities computed from TI balances may be          
#E  unreliable, especially for the weaker branches. The evaluator has     
#E  not listed beta-transition data for this decay scheme.                
#G           Data on the unplaced |g's are from 1976Gr20. 2002Ca49 do     
#G  not show any unplaced |g's.                                           
#G           A number of |g's reported by 1976Gr20 originate from         
#G  levels whose existence has not been confirmed by 2002Ca49. Those      
#G  |g's from levels below 2982 keV that have not been placed             
#G  elsewhere in the level scheme are listed as unplaced without comment. 
#G  |g's from levels above this energy that may be placed elsewhere are   
#G  indicated by appropriate comments.                                    
#G           The EG and RI values for the |g's reported by 1976Gr20       
#G  and 2002Ca49 differ somewhat. Where the placement of a |g by          
#G  these authors differs, the evaluator has adopted that of 2002Ca49     
#G  and has made an association of the |g from 1976Gr20 with that of      
#G  2002Ca49.                                                             
#G E,RI      RI values are quoted relative to RI(137.8 G)=100. The RI data
#G  from 2002Ca49 are based on the analysis of coincidence spectra. These 
#G  authors list upper limits on RI values for many |g's that they do     
#G  not observe but which might be expected to occur based on JPI         
#G  considerations. In most instances, these are not given here.          
#G RI        Values from 2002Ca49, unless noted otherwise.                
#G E(F)      Nominal value from level-energy difference.                  
#G E(G)      Transition previously reported but not in |e decay.          
#G E(H)      Transition previously placed from a level below 2982 keV     
#G  whose existence was not confirmed by 2002Ca49.                        
#G M         From the 156DY Adopted Gamma Radiations data set. Where a    
#G  reasonable association of a |g from 2002Ca49 can be made with one     
#G  from 1976Gr20, the evaluator has assigned the mult from 1976Gr20.     
#G CC        Values for |g's with E0 components are discussed in the      
#G  {+156}Dy Adopted |g Radiations data set.                              
#G TI        Computed by 1976Gr20 from ce intensities.                    
#L           Several levels reported by 1976Gr20 have not been confirmed

#L  2661.2; 2803.05; 2933.51. Also, the data of 2002Ca49 do not support   
#L  the existence of levels above 2982 keV. Previously proposed levels in 
#L  this region include: 2992.31; 3071.76; 3161.64; 3177.36; 3308.9;

#L           A number of levels not previously reported in |e decay       
#L  have been proposed by 2002Ca49. These are included here but are not

#  1999KaZV: Source produced by high-energy proton-induced spallation on  
#   W targets using the on-line isotope-separator facility ^YASNAPP-2.    
#   Measured |g radiation, ICC and GG coincidences. Data are presented

#  1976IwZZ: Source produced in the 160DY(P,5N) reaction, EP=52 MeV.      
#   Source material contained both the isomer and the 156HO g.s.

#G  2003KaZP is significantly different from that reported by             
#G  1999KaZV. This leads to significant intensity imbalances at the
