#  2011El07: {+180}Tl activity produced from spallation of UC{-x} with    
#  E(p)=1.4 GeV and separated with resonant laser ionization technique    
#  and the High Resolution Separator. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, E(ce),     
#  I(ce) using a Miniball cluster detector (consisting of three HPGe      
#  crystals) and two Si detectors.                                        
#  Other: 2013El08, deduced asymmetric fission of excited levels          
#  populated in {+180}Tl decay.                                           
#  The decay scheme is most likely incomplete, as the highest observed    
#  level is at only |?2.5 MeV compared with the large Q value for the     
#  decay (10.99 MeV). A total energy release of 9.6 MeV {I3} is           
#  calculated for this decay scheme using the RADLST code, compared with  
#  the effective Q value of 10.3 keV {I4}.                                
#L E$From a least-squares fit to E|g by evaluator.                        
#L J$From the Adopted Levels                                              
#G E$Uncertainties taken as 0.2 keV for I|g>1.5% and 0.5 keV for          
#G I|g|<1.5% from a general statement by 2011El07.                        
#G RI$Intensities relative to I|g(434|g)=100; values do not include a     
#G correction for summing.                                                
#G M$From the Adopted Gammas                                              
#E TI$From an intensity balance at each level. Feedings are considered    
#E to be upper limits given the large Q value of the decay (10.99 MeV)    
#E and the highest observed level at only |?2.5 MeV.
