#  1995Me03: {+180}Yb activity from {+197}Au or {+136}Xe at 11            
#  MeV/nucleon on targets of natural W or Re. Channel selection using     
#  online mass separator, fast tape transport system, and the             
#  FEBIAD-B2-C ion source to suppress contamination from {+180}Lu.        
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g, and I(ce) using setups of two Ge        
#  detectors and a 4|p|b counter or a low-energy Ge detector and a        
#  mini-orange electron spectrometer.                                     
#  1987Ru04: {+180}Yb activity from {+186}W at 15 MeV/nucleon on targets  
#  of natural W or Ta. Channel selection with GSI online mass separator   
#  and fast transport tape system. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, and |b|g      
#  using a plastic 4|p|b detector and |g and |g/X Ge detectors.           
#  The level scheme is that of 1995Me03. The level scheme proposed by     
#  1987Ru04 is in general agreement, except for the omission of the       
#  13.9-keV level, which results in all the level energies in 1987Ru04    
#  quoted as 13.9-keV lower than those in 1995Me03. Configuration         
#  assignments are from 1995Me03.                                         
#B IB$From intensity balance at each level and assuming E1 multipolarity  
#B for the 172.9|g.                                                       
#B IB,LOGFT$Large uncertainties on I|g's and unknown multipolarities      
#B make a precise determination of I|b{+-} difficult. Both I|b{+-} and    
#B Log {Ift} should be considered approximate.                            
#G E$From 1987Ru04, except where noted. E|g's were measured in            
#G coincidence with |b{+-}.                                               
#G RI$From 1995Me03. Values from 1987Ru04 are included in the comments.   
#G E(A)$From 1995Me03                                                     
#G M$Determined from conversion electron data (1995Me03); no specific     
#G details are given by authors.                                          
#L E$From a least-squares fit to E|g's by the evaluator. |DE|g=0.3 keV    
#L is taken when no uncertainty is given.                                 
#L J,T$From the Adopted Levels                                            
#L J(c)$Calculated two-quasiparticle spectrum predicts two closely lying  
#L 1+ states around 1 MeV in excitation energy with configurations        
#L (|n1/2{+-}[510])(|p1/2{+-}[514]) and (|n7/2{+-}[514])(|p9/2{+-}[514]). 
#  Total energy release is calculated as 2180 keV {I130} by the RADLST    
#  code, in general agreement with the Q value of 2080 keV {I210, syst}.  
#  However, due to large uncertainties on I|g's, unknown                  
#  multipolarities, and a difference of 1 MeV between the highest         
#  observed level and the decay Q value, the level scheme should be       
#  considered incomplete.
