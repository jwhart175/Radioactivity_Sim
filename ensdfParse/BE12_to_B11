#  1978Al10: Activity produced in the {+10}Be(t,p) reaction was measured  
#  with a plastic scintillation detector to measure |b-rays. The          
#  tritium beam was pulsed with a mechanical chopper (20 ms activation/400
#  ms counting), and counting was carried out using a 5 cm thick          
#  NE102 plastic scintillator detector. Using the least squares analysis, 
#  half-life T{-1/2}=24.4 ms {I30} was obtained, but note the analysis    
#  involved taking into account the activity from other radionuclides     
#  produced in {+10}B+t reactions ({+8}Li, {+9}Li, {+12}Be).              
#  An attempt was made to observe delayed neutrons using a moderated      
#  {+3}He neutron counter; an upper limit of P{-n} |< 1% was obtained that
#  depended on the {+9}Li delayed-neutron branching ratio. At the time the
#  P{-n} of {+9}Li was taken as 35% (1974Aj01), but this value has been   
#  revised to 50.8% so the limit of (1978Al10) should be adjusted         
#  proportionally.                                                        
#  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
#  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
#  filter and transferes to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The           
#  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
#  nuclides. The ions were implanted in a Si detector and identified      
#  by standard techniques. The beta-delayed neutrons were detected in a   
#  polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter; half-lives and beta-delayed     
#  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
#  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of beta-delayed neutrons  
#  detected in the zero-threshold counter. This experiment has clear      
#  evidence of neutron emission with a P{-n} of 0.9% {I4} which is        
#  consistent with the published upper limit (1978Al10) and is more       
#  precise with the benefit of mass separtion. In addition, the half-life 
#  T{-1/2}=45 ms {I29} was measured.                                      
#  A subsequent conference report with the same author indicates the      
#  |b-delayed neutron probability P{-n}=0.52% {I9} and T{-1/2}=21.32 ms   
#  {I6} (the International conference on nuclear data for science and     
#  technology: nuclear data for the twenty-first century, Gatlinburg, TN  
#  (United States), 9-13 May 1994) .                                      
#  1994Ke06: A beam of {+12}Be was produced by bombarding a Be target with
#  63 MeV/A {+18}O ions from the GANIL cyclotrons. The {+12}Be ions were  
#  identified as they were implanted in a plastic scintillator that       
#  was surrounded by a plastic scintillator beta counter.  A HPGe detector
#  measured gamma-rays from the decay, and the beta-gamma coincident      
#  events were analyzed during a 250 ms beam-off period. T{-1/2}=26.2 ms  
#  {I24} was deduced. No clear evidence was found for de-excitation of    
#  levels in {+11}B, and upper limits on the decay intensity to           
#  {+12}B*(2621,2723) states were estimated as 0.008% {I6} and 0.040%     
#  {I26}, respectively. Hence, no detailed decay scheme has been          
#  experimentally confirmed.                                              
#  1999Be53: An uranium carbide target was bombarded by a 1-GeV proton    
#  beam to produce a {+12}Be beam that was implanted in a kapton foil     
#  located at the center of a {+3}He cylindrical neutron counter array.   
#  The |b-particles from {+12}Be decay were detected by a plastic         
#  scintillator located directly behind the implantation foil. The        
#  P{-n} value was determined from the rate of neutrons detected in the   
#  {+3}He counter. The measurement is relative to the "known" P{-n} value 
#  of {+9}Li=50.0% {I18} (1991Re02). The value P{-n}=0.50 % {I3} was      
#  obtained; an additional proceedings result of P{-n}=0.48% {I+12}{I-10} 
#  (U. Koster et al., AIP Conf. Proc. 455 (1998) p. 989) is mentioned in  
#  the text.                                                              
#  2002Be53: A layered Ta target with improved Be release time            
#  (vs 1999Be53) was used to improve the {+12}Be |b-decay life-time       
#  studies. As in (1999Be53), protons from the CERN/ISOLDE facility       
#  bombarded the spallation target to produce {+12}Be. The measured time  
#  distributions of |b particles and delayed neutrons gave a weighted mean
#  and improved value of T{-1/2}=21.49 ms {I3}. See also 2001Be53         
#  T{-1/2}=21.50 ms {I4}, which is based on the same data.                
#  Comments: The value P{-n}=0.50 % {I3} (1999Be53) appears to be the most
#  reliable value found in the literature. It is in agreement with        
#  P{-n}=0.52% {I9} from the LANL work, but clearer experimental          
#  details are given in the discussion. The lifetime analysis is a bit    
#  more complicated. The values given in (1991Re02 and associated works)  
#  are comparible with the weighted average of values in                  
#  (1978Al10, 1984Du15, 1986Cu01, 1994Ke06, 2002Be53), however there is   
#  little information available explaining the sometimes significant      
#  variation in values given in (1991Re02) and those in the later         
#  works that used significantly overlapping data sets.
