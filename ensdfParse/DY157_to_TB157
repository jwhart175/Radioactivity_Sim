#  {+157}Dy has been produced by several reactions including              
#       {+159}Tb(p,3n), {+159}Tb(d,4n), Gd(|a,xn), Er(p,3pxn),            
#       {+163}Dy(p,p4n), and p spallation of Ta target.  Measurements     
#       include |g singles and |g|g coincidences with NaI and Ge          
#       detectors, ce in magnetic spectrometers, lifetimes by             
#       several methods, and |g(|q,t).                                    
#            The decay scheme is that of 1997Ad08 which agrees with       
#       the earlier ones of 1967Bl12 and 1966Fu06 with the addition       
#       of several levels and many |g's.  Some of the |g rays             
#       placed by 1997Ad08 are based on energy combinations and some      
#       are placed from levels previously reported in the (d,2n|g) and    
#       (p,t) studies.

#E TI        The evaluator has set the direct feeding of the 326 level    
#E      to 96% {I4} based on the reported values of 94% {I2} (1963Pe20)   
#E      and 98% (1967Bl12).  The remaining |e+|b{++} feedings follow      
#E      from the intensity balances.                                      
#E TI        The |e+|b+ intensities are the same as the |e intensities,   
#E      since the smallest capture-to-positron ratio is 2.6|*10{+3} and   
#E      96% transition to the 326 level is below the threshold for        
#E      |b{++} emission.                                                  
#G           The |g|g coincidence data shown in drawing are from          
#G      1966Fu06, 1961To02, and 1997Ad08.                                 
#G           1997Ad08 report upper limits for the intensities of a        
#G      number of |g rays that have been reported depopulating J = 7/2    
#G      and 9/2 levels in (d,2n|g) (1971Wi24).  These limits and the      
#G      associated levels are (the |g energies are from 1971Wi24): 68.3   
#G      keV, I{-|g} < 0.0012 from 425 keV level; 99.1, <0.0015 from       
#G      425; 137.3, <0.0012 from 709; 156.2, <3.0 from 513; 186.3,        
#G      <0.0020 from 513; 191.6, <0.0023 from 252; 214, <0.0009 from      
#G      571; 251.1, <0.0011 from 658; 282.1, <0.0009 from 425; 331.1,     
#G      <0.0037 from 658; 347.1, <0.0037 from 407; 351.5, <0.0037         
#G      from 709; 370.0, <0.0018 from 513; 408.0, <0.0025 from 407;       
#G      453.0, <0.0020 from 513; and 650, <0.0011 from 793 level.  Of     
#G      the levels in this list, those at 252, 658, and 793 are           
#G      reported by 1997Ad08 based on the placement of other |g rays.     
#G      For these three levels, the limits from 1997Ad08 are              
#G      consistent with the data from 1971Wi24.
