#  2010CR02: SOURCE FROM 9BE(76GE,XG) E=130 MEV/NUCLEON, TOF TECHNIQUE,   
#  Measured |b particles using NSCL Beta Counting System of three Si PIN  
#  detectors, a double-sided silicon strip detector and six single sided  
#  silicon strip detectors. Detected prompt and delayed |g rays in coin   
#  with fragments using 16 Ge detectors of the Segmented Germanium array. 
#  2012KA36: SOURCE FROM BE(238U,XG), {+238}U beam at E=345 MeV/nucleon,  
#  fission fragments were separated and analyzed by BigRIPS separator,    
#  to focal plane of ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in     
#  transported an aluminum stopper. Particle identification was achieved  
#  by |DE-tof-B|RHO method. Delayed gamma rays from microsecond isomers   
#  were detected by three clover-type HPGe detectors. Measured E|g,       
#  I|g, |g|g-coin, and isomer half-life.
