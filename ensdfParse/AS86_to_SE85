#  {+86}As with T{-1/2}|?0.9 s identified (1966To02, 1967De01, 1968To18,  
#  1968To19, 1969WaZS) by observing the decay of its descendents, {+86}Se 
#  and {+86}Br, and by counting of delayed neutrons after separation of   
#  arsenic sample from other fission products of {+235}U.                 
#  1993Ru01: measured %|b{+-}n value and T{-1/2} of {+86}As from neutron  
#  and |b intensities at Studsvik facility                                
#  2013AgZY: measured %|b{+-}n value from neutron and |b intensities      
#  at JYFL facility using BELEN neutron counter Si detectors for |b.      
#  This value most likely includes |b{+-}2n contribution, although, it    
#  is predicted to be negligible in theoretical calculations (1997Mo25)   
#  T{-1/2} and %|b{+-}n measurements: 1973Kr06 (also 1974KrZG,1975Kr08),
