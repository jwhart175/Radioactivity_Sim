#  The total average radiation energy released by {+68}Co |b-decay (1.6   
#  s) is 9700 {I300} (calculated by evaluator using computer program      
#  RADLST), 16% lower than 11550 {I130}, suggesting an incomplete decay   
#  scheme. This is supported by |b-|g coincidence measurements which      
#  estimate AP 50% of the |b-decay proceeds via unresolved levels that    
#  subsequently |g-decay to low-lying levels in {+68}Ni (2000Mu10).       
#L E$From a least-squares fit to E|g's by evaluator.

#G $I|g(511|g)=20.8 {I5}.  Nearly all the intensity is coincident with    
#G |b particles and can be accounted for as 511-511 coincidences.  The    
#G 511|g's are prompt with |b particles within the |? 15 ns time          
#G resolution; thus it can be ruled out that the 511|g originates from    
#G the 1770 0+ state which has T{-1/2}=211 ns {I50}.  2000Mu10 propose    
#G the source of the 511|g may be an E0 transition from the decay of the  
#G 2511 state to the g.s.                                                 
#L J(a)$Low-lying J=1 states are not expected from the available neutron  
#L fp orbitals. A strong |g to the g.s. indicates J|p=2+ for the 2744     
#L state. Lack of a similar transition from the 2512 state and the        
#L possible E0 transition to the g.s. supports a J|p=0+ assignment.

#L observation of a 694|g and 1139|g with T{-1/2}|?1.6 s which are        
#L non-coincident with any other transitions, suggesting they directly    
#L populate the 5- 2849 isomeric level (2000Mu10). This, however, is in   
#L disagreement with the direct population of these levels from J|p=(1+)  
#L and thus, the evaluator considers their existence tentative.
