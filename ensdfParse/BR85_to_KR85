#  0.18% decay to 85KR(10.756 Y), 99.82% decay to 85KR (4.480 H).         
#  1975Nu03: 85BR source prepared by fast chemical separation of 235U     
#  fission products. Contributions from 85BR decay were enhanced by       
#  varying the separation time. Measured E|g, I|g, I|b. Deduced levels,   
#  J, |p, |b branches, log {Ift}                                          
#  1975Hu02: irradiations were carried out in a beam hole of the LIDO     
#  reactor at Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, Didcot,      
#  Berkshire. Measured E|g, I|g. Deduced levels, |g branching ratios.     
#  1971Er15: samples containing 2.0 mg of 93.5% enriched {+235}U were     
#  irradiated in the MIT reactor. Measured E|g, I|g. Deduced levels,      
#  |g branching ratios.

#G E,RI$Unless noted otherwise, E|g and I|g data given are from 1975Nu03. 
#G 1971Er15 and 1975Hu02 observed |g rays at 802, 832, and 925 KEV.       
#G The 832G is ascribed by 1975Hu02 to 90RB decay but, according to       
#G 1975Nu03, it contains weak contributions from both 85BR and 87BR.      
#G E(A)$Assignment to 85BR is uncertain.
