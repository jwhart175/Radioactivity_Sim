#E by the evaluators. The feedings given by 2009Sa09 are given under      
#E comments                                                               
#E $ Since this decay has a Q value of over { 5 MeV} and the only         
#E observed levels are below 2.5 MeV, the scheme is                       
#E incomplete.  Therefore, the |e intensities are upper limits and
