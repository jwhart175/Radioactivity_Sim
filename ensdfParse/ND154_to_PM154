#  The decay scheme, E|g, I|g are from 1993GrZZ and the measured I|b-     
#    data are from 1995Gr19 and 1997Gr09 (all by the same authors),       
#    unless otherwise noted. Other: 1985Ka17. Activity also               
#    identified by 1974Bu09. Earlier articles by the same authors as      
#    1993GrZZ are 1990An31, 1988GrZY, 1987Gr12, 1986GrZW, and 1986GrZZ.   
#  This decay scheme is given here with its lowest level shown as         
#    being at 0 keV. However, this level may be an isomer, as             
#    discussed in the {+154}Pm Adopted Levels.

#    Established parentage.                                               
#  1985Ka17: Produced by {+235}U(th n,f), followed by isotope separation. 
#    Parentage of {+154}Pm (1.7 min) established; and 19 |g's reported.   
#  1986GrZW, 1993GrZZ: Produced by spontaneous fission of {+252}Cf,       
#    followed by isotope separation. |g's measured with Ge detectors.     
#    50 |g's reported. (Both references are private communications.)      
#  1987Gr12: Produced by spontaneous fission of {+252}Cf, followed by     
#    isotope separation. Parent half-life and 13 |g energies reported.    
#  1990An31: Produced by spontaneous fission of {+252}Cf, followed by     
#    isotope separation. Level scheme is shown.                           
#  1995Gr19, 1997Gr09: Produced by spontaneous fission of {+252}Cf,       
#    followed by isotope separation. Deduced I|b- to excited states       
#    and ground state from total absorption |g spectra.                   
#B           The I|b- to the excited levels have been deduced,            
#B      independently of the |g data, from the total absorption |g        
#B      spectrometer, TAGS, data of 1997Gr09. When necessary, new         
#B      levels, called "pseudolevels", and associated decay |g's are      
#B      included in the analysis. Since the resolution of the TAGS        
#B      system is typically 50-100 keV, the intensity assigned to a       
#B      pseudolevel may thus represent the |b- feeding to a single        
#B      level or to a group of levels in that region.                     
#B IB        Values are from |g intensity balances, except those          
#B      for the 0- and 79-keV levels, which are from measurements of      
#B      1995Gr19. The I|b- values from the TAGS data (1997Gr09) are       
#B      generally in excellent agreement with those from the intensity    
#B      balances. The TAGS value is given in a comment if it differs      
#B      by more than 10%.  Since the scheme is not complete, values       
#B      less than 0.2% are not given, except in comments. Values for      
#B      levels at 50, 68, and 105 keV are assumed to be 0.                
#B IB        The pseudolevels and the associated I|b- from the TAGS       
#B      data analysis are 1270 keV, 0.4%; 1470, 0.6; 1550, 0.8%; 1800,    
#B      0.3%; and 1900, 0.3%.                                             
#G E         From 1993GrZZ.                                               
#G RI        From 1993GrZZ. Values have not been corrected for            
#G      coincidence summing, which in the worst cases could be as         
#G      large as 30%.                                                     
#G M         From {+154}Pm adopted |g radiations. Based on data of        
#G      1993GrZZ, from |a{-K}(exp), from IKx/I|g ratio or from            
#G      |a(exp) based on intensity balances from |g|g coincidence         
#G      spectra.                                                          
#G E(R)      Existence and placement of |g is questionable.               
#L E         From least-squares fit to |g energies, with questionable     
#L      |g's omitted.                                                     
#L J         Authors' assignments, most of which are not shown in
