#  1994Sh02: {+219}Ra activity was produced as the daughter nuclide of    
#  {+223}Th through the {+208}Pb({+18}O,3n){+223}Th reaction. Measured    
#  E|a, I|a, |a|g coin from a source in equilibrium with {+223}Th.        
#  Detectors:  Semiconductor, Ge(Li) detector.                            
#  1987El02: {+219}Ra activity was produced as descendant of {+223}Th.    
#  Measured E|a, E|g, I|g, Ice, |a|g coin, |a-ce coin. Detectors: semi,   
#  Ge(Li), Si(Li). Assignment of |a-particle groups to {+219}Ra has been  
#  based on the agreement with E|a from 1970Va13, and on the observation  
#  of Rn K| x ray in coincidence with |a particles.                       
#  Because of the decay scheme normalization, evaluators interpreted      
#  absolute |g-ray transition intensities reported by authors as          
#  absolute I(|g+ce) (photons plus conversion electrons) intensities.     
#  1970Va13: {+219}Ra activity was produced by {+208}Pb({+16}O,|an), and  
#  identified by excitation functions, cross bombardment, and genetic     
#  relationship to its |a-decay daughter nucleus {+215}Rn. Measured E|a,  
#  I|a.  Semiconductor detector.                                          
#  1969Ha32: {+219}Ra activity was produced as descendant of {+227}U,     
#  {+223}Th, and identified by its genetic relationship to its |a-decay   
#  daughter nucleus {+215}Rn. Measured E|a, I|a. Semiconductor detector.  
#A IA(X)$Deduced by evaluators from |g-ray transition intensity balance.  
#A HF$Using r{-0}({+215}Rn)=1.5595 {I60}, interpolated value deduced from

#G $See 1989Ha26 for |a|g(|q).

#G TI$Absolute transition intensity measured relative to %I(|g+ce)=66.2   
#G {I15} for 316|g. This value resulted from a precise measurement of     
#G the |a-particle abundance that populates the 316 level (1987El02).
