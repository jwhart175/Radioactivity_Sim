#  2004He25: produced using the {+204}Pb({+12}C,5n) reaction at GSI.      
#  Evaporation residues were separated from the primary beam by the       
#  velocity filter SHIP and were implanted into a 16-strip PIPS           
#  detector. |g-rays were detected in prompt or delayed coincidence       
#  using a HP Ge-Detector and a clover detector consisting of four Ge     
#  crystals. Measured E|g, I|g, T{-1/2}.                                  
#  2006Ha17: produced  in commissioning experiment using                  
#  {+174}Yb({+40}Ar,3n) reaction. Evaporation residues were transported   
#  by the VASSILISSA separator and implanted into a 16-strip              
#  position-sensitive Si detector.  The focal plane detector is           
#  surrounded by  a GABRIELA setup of seven Ge detectors, six of which are
#  inside BGO Compton shields. Measured E|g, T{-1/2} using |g-spectra     
#  from unsuppressed  detector. Authors state their value T{-1/2}=9.7     
#  |ms {I6} requires further independent confirmation therefore           
#  evaluators have not used it to obtain average values.
