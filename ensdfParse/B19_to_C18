#  1998Yo06: A beam of {+19}B was produced by fragmentation of a 95 MeV/A 
#  {+40}Ar beam on a {+181}Ta target. {+19}B was selected using the RIKEN 
#  Projectile-fragment Separator (RIPS) and was implanted into a 12 mm    
#  thick plastic scintillator stopper. The |b-decays were observed during 
#  the 100 ms beam-off period. The active stopper detected |b-rays and a  
#  neutron detector array, consisting of 14 liquid scintillation counters 
#  covering about 80% of 4|p detected delayed neutrons. The efficiency of 
#  the neutron array was 30% by comparison of a measurement of |b-delayed 
#  neutrons of {+15}B, which has a known delayed neutron emission         
#  probability of 100%.                                                   
#  A preliminary value of T{-1/2}=3.3 ms {I2} was dedcued from the        
#  least-squares fits to the data, and P{-n}=125% {I32} was determined    
#  from the ratio of the number of detected neutrons to that of |b-rays.  
#  P{-n} is more than 100% which implies the existence of significant     
#  multineutron emissions in the decay, reflecting its large Q{-|b} value 
#  (26.5 MeV) compared with the multineutron separation energies of       
#  daughter nucleus {+19}C (S{-1n}=160 keV, S{-2n}=4.4 MeV,.....).        
#  2003Yo02: The authors reevaluated the preliminary values T{-1/2} and   
#  P{-n} reported in 1998Yo06. The new experiment was performed using     
#  RIPS at RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility as was in 1998Yo06. A beam 
#  of {+19}B was produced by the projectile-fragmentation reaction of a   
#  95 MeV/{Iu} {+40}Ar beam on a 670 mg/cm{+2} {+nat}Ta target. The values
#  of T{-1/2} and P{-{Ii}n} were determined by fitting a set of decay     
#  curves altogether to remove possible complication and inconsistency.   
#  The method of maximum likelihood was applied for deducing T{-1/2} and  
#  P{-{Ii}n}. The neutron detection efficiencies were treated carefully,  
#  the total detection efficiencies of direct and scattered neutrons are  
#  31.5 % {I3} and 4.7% {I+2}{I-6}, respectively. The new values of       
#  T{-1/2}=2.92 ms {I13}, P{-1n}=71.8% {I+83}{I-91} and P{-2n}=16.0%      
#  {I+56}{I-48} were determined with a better precision. P{-3n} was not   
#  determined because of the limited statistics. In the text it is unclear
#  if the 1998Yo06 "preliminary" data are included in the 2003Yo02        
#  analysis; we assume that it is and use the 2003Yo02 result to avoid    
#  possible data correlations.                                            
#  1999Re16: A low statistics determination of T{-1/2}=4.5 ms {I15} was   
#  given.
