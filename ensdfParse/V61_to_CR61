#  2014Su07: {+61}V beam produced from fragmentation of 120 MeV/nucleon   
#  {+76}Ge beam on {+9}Be target, followed by mass separation by A1900    
#  separator at NSCL-MSU accelerator facility. The resulting cocktail ion 
#  beam was transported to the Beta Counting System and implanted into a  
#  1-mm-thick double-sided silicon strip detector. Measured E|g, I|g,     
#  |g|g-coin using SeGA array. Deduced levels J, |p, estimate of %|b{+-}n 
#  Comparisons made with shell-model calculations                         
#  2005Ga01: {+61}V produced in fragmentation of {+76}Ge{+30+} beam on    
#  {+58}Ni target. LISE3 achromatic spectrometer used to separate         
#  fragments; magnetic rigidity was tuned to optimize transmission of     
#  {+62}V and {+64}Cr fragments. Transmitted nuclei were identified by    
#  three consecutive Si detectors where two served for energy loss and    
#  time-of-flight measurements while the last determined their residual   
#  energies. Measured E|g, I|g, I|b, |g|g, |b|g coin, |g(t), lifetimes    
#  with four Ge detectors placed around a thick Si telescope.  Half-lives 
#  determined by fitting procedures involving five parameters: half-lives 
#  of mother, daughter and grand-daughter nuclei, the |b-efficiency and   
#  the background rate over the 1 s collecting time. Tentative levels at  
#  97, 310, 450 and 1027 proposed in 2005Ga01, all but the 310 level have 
#  been confirmed by 2014Su07                                             
#  2003So02: same method of {+61}V production as in 2005Ga01. measured    
#  half-life of {+61}V decay and probability of delayed-neutron decay     
#  from the observation of 2+ to 0+ transition in {+60}Cr.                
#  1999So20 (also 2001So07 and 1999Le67): {+61}V produced in the          
#  fragmentation of 60.4 MeV/nucleon {+86}Kr beam with {+58}Ni target;    
#  LISE3 spectrometer at GANIL facility. Measured half-lives of decays    
#  of {+61}V and {+61}Cr.                                                 
#  Theoretical calculations: 1995Ri05 Shell model calculations            
#  (predicted spin, binding energy, mass defect).
