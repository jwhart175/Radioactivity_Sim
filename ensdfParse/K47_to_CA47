#  1970Wa29: measured G's and G(T); GE(LI), pneumatic shutter. Note that  
#  1984Al18 give data from the study by 1970Wa29 which were not explicitly
#  included in the paper.                                                 
#  1984Al18: Measured |g's; Ge(Li), rabbit system. New delayed |g's from  
#  {+48}Ca+t reactions assigned by comparison of spectra from enriched    
#  and natural CaCO{-3} targets and half-life considerations.
