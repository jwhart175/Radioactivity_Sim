#  2005MA96: 31NA was produced at ^ISOLDE facility, ^CERN. Thin plastic   
#  scintillator detector, 2 ^BaF{-2} detectors and 2 HPGe detectors;      
#  Measured: EG, level T, BGG (t) COIN, deduced level scheme.             
#  1993KL02: 31NA was produced bombarding a uranium carbide target with   
#  600 MeV protons from the ^CERN synchrocyclotron, mass separated in the 
#  ^ISOLDE facility; ^NE102 plastic scintillator, 2 HPGe detectors and one
#  neutron detector; Measured: EG, IG, B-G COIN, B-GG COIN, B-G- n COIN,  
#  deduced level scheme.                                                  
#  1984GU19: 31NA was produced in the fragmentation of iridium target by  
#  10 GeV protons from the ^CERN synchrotron, recoiled fragments were     
#  thermalized, ionized and mass-separated; Ge(Li) detector, Measured: EG,
#  B-GG COIN, absolute RI.
