#  112SN(28SI,3p2n) E=190 MEV followed by on-line mass separation.        
#  Measured T1/2, GAMMA rays, CE, GG, GCE                                 
#  1995VE08: measured B+ end-point energies, deduced Q value              
#  Others: 1982ALZO, 1977BO02, 1975VA14. 1977BO02 reported five GAMMA rays
#  from 135PM decay and 1982ALZO reported 33 GAMMA rays                   
#  The EC+B+ feedings and associated LOGFT values are given by 1989VI04 as
#  limits based on their proposed level scheme, but in the absence of     
#  clear separation between the level schemes for the two activities      
#  (45 s and 49 s), the evaluators consider the available data to be      
#  insufficient to determine such values reliably.                        
#  The separation of the decay schemes from the two activities is         
#  not considered as well established by the evaluators due to the        
#  two half-lives being close in value. In the work of 1989Vi04 this      
#  separation was based mainly on the decay pattern to                    
#  high- and low-spin states in the daughter nucleus from the parent      
#  activities with spins (11/2-) and (3/3+,5/2+). 1989Vi04 state that     
#  low-spin isomer in their work is mainly populated from the decay of    
#  {+135}Sm whereas the high-spin isomer is populated in heavy-ion        
#  reaction. The growth and decay properties of certain |g rays for       
#  example that of 128.8|g clearly show the presence of two activities.   
#  Total decay energy of 1232 KEV 105 calculated (by ^RADLIST code)       
#  from level scheme is much lower than the expected value of 6240 KEV 60 
#  The decay scheme has not been normalized for                           
#  RI/100 decays of the parent since the populated levels are             
#  known only up to about 745; whereas, the Q value is AP 5940.           
#  Also no data exist for transition multipolarities and for EC,B+ feeding
#  to g.s. The decay scheme as given by 1989VI04 implies NR=0.3, based on 
#  IB(EC+B+)(to GS)<14%
