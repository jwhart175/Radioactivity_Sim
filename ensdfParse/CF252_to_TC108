#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g using Gammasphere array of 72 Compton          
#  suppressed Ge detectors.                                               
#  The isotopes identification is based on the known |g of the Cs nuclei  
#  which are the fission partners of Tc isotopes.                         
#  1970Jo20, 1970Wa05, 1972Ho08, 1973TaZG have measured                   
#  gammas and proposed them as transitions in {+108}Tc arising            
#  from prompt deexcitation of fission fragments from {+252}Cf(SF).       
#  Mass assignments for the transitions were deduced from                 
#  measurements of the fission fragments in coincidence with the          
#  respective |g's (1970Jo20,1970Wa05,1973TaZG,1976ChZD). Nucleus         
#  assignment is based on measurement of                                  
#  the K| x ray's emitted in coincidence with the |g's                    
#  (1970Wa05,1972Ho08,1973TaZG,1976ChZD).                                 
#  Only those |g's reported by more than one author are listed            
#  below. Only 1998HW04 has proposed level scheme, even though            
#  1973TaZG measured |g|g-coincidences.                                   
#  The level scheme is as given by 1998HW04
