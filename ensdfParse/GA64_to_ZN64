#G E,RI$From 1975Ra28, unless otherwise stated. Values from 1990SuZR are  
#G given under comments (in ENSDF). EG's given by 1990SuZR are            
#G systematically higher than those given by 1975Ra28. In the range       
#G 750 to 4610, the deviation is from 0.5 to 2 KEV. RI's given by 1990SuZR
#G agree well with those given by 1975Ra28, but no uncertainties are
