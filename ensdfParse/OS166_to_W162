#  DATA SET UPDATED (MAY, 2006) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE NEW QA VALUE.      
#  1978Ca11: 166OS produced in the 106CD(63CU,p2n) reaction on an         
#  enriched (86.22% 106CD) target and in the 107AG(63CU,4n) reaction on   
#  an enriched (97.87% 107AG) target. E(63CU)=380 MEV. The 63CU energy    
#  was degraded using thin nickel foils to obtain excitation functions    
#  and mass assignments. The reaction products were transported for       
#  study using ^He-jet techniques. Measured T and EA. See also 1977Ca23.  
#  1981Ho10: 166OS produced by 58NI bombardment. ALPHA spectra measured   
#  with SI detector following separation of the reaction products using   
#  a velocity selector. Report T1/2, EA and %A. See also 1981HoZM.        
#  1991Se01: 166OS produced as a decay product of the 106CD+74SE reaction,
#  with E(74SE)=340 MEV. Enriched (80% 106CD) target of thickness         
#  500 |mg/cm{+2}. Reaction products were separated using the ^Daresbury  
#  recoil mass separator and were subsequently implanted into a           
#  position-sensitive SI surface-barrier detector. Reported T.            
#  1996Pa01: 166IR produced as a fusion evaporation product in the        
#  112SN+58NI reaction, with E(58NI)=297 and 329 MEV. The 112SN target    
#  (enrichment not given) was AP 0.9 mg/cm{+2} thick. The recoil          
#  products were separated in flight in the ^Daresbury recoil mass        
#  spectrometer and implanted in a double-sided silicon-strip detector    
#  (energy resolution LE 20 keV FWHM). Reported T1/2, EA.
