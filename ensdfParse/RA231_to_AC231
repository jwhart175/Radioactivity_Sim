#  {+231}Ra has been produced via two methods. The first one utilized the 
#  spallation reactions to produce the A=231 isobars following            
#  a bombardment of a UC{-2}-C target with a 1 GeV proton beam from       
#  CERN PS-Booster.                                                       
#  In the second experiment, the Ta(Re) surface ionizer was employed      
#  were the {+231}Ac was produced through the decay chain                 
#  {+231}Fr --> {+231}Ra -->{+231}Ac. The ions were accelerated to        
#  60 keV then recorded on a magnetic tape after mass separation.         
#  Detection system: to measure the half-lives of the excited states, a   
#  3 mm thick NE111A plastic scintillator was used in the                 
#  Advanced Time Delayed (ATD) |b|g|g(t) technique.                       
#  Conversion electrons were measured with a                              
#  mini-orange spectrometer.

#G $Evaluators' calculated (using the RADLST code) x-ray intensities of

#G 90.86 {I6} (K{-|a1}) significantly disagree with experimental values   
#G of 903 {I106} for 87.66 {I5} (K{-|a2})                                 
#G and 1411 {I165} for 90.86 {I6} (K{-|a1}) given in 2008Bo29.            
#G This discrepancy suggests incorrect G-ray multipolarities and therefore
#G does not warrant neither deducing a decay-scheme normalization factor  
#G nor B- intensities from G-ray transition intensity balances.
