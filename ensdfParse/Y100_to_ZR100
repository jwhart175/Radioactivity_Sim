#  1986Wo01: Measured G, GG, GG(THETA), CE, BG. See also 1990Wo01         
#  for discussion of level structure. The 100Y isotope produced by        
#  neutron fission of 235U and mass separation of A=100 ion-beam          
#  (at ^TRISTAN facility) containing only the 100RB and 100SR activities. 
#  The B- decay of 100SR (JPI(GS)=0+) to 100Y is expected to populate     
#  only the low spin 735-MS isomer (most likely the GS of 100Y). The      
#  presence of the 0.94-s isomer is estimated as LT 1% by 1986Wo01        
#  The decay scheme from G and GG data of 1986Wo01 represents a           
#  significant improvement over the one suggested by 1985Mu07

#  2002Lh01: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g coin. Source of 100Y obtained        
#  from 238U(p,^X) E(p)=600 MEV, followed by mass separation using        
#  ^OSTIS mass separator at ^Grenoble                                     
#  Others:                                                                
#  1977Kh03: Measured G, GG, CE. Isotope 100Y obtained by mass            
#  separation of A=100 recoils from 235U(N,F)                             
#  1977Pf01: Measured E|g, I|g, T1/2(100Y isotope)                        
#  1979Bo26: Measured selected E|g using curved-crystal measurement       
#  The identification of this isomer is based on the observation of       
#  an intense 352G, decaying with T1/2=0.96 S and in coincidence          
#  with the 212G to the g.s. The 352G is most likely the same as the      
#  (4+) to 2+ transition observed in 252CF SF decay. 1977Kh03 assigned    
#  five G rays to this isomer only, on the basis of T1/2 data, but the    
#  later work of 1986Wo01 showed that all these G rays were also present  
#  in the decay of the 735-MS isomer, with the difference that the 352G   
#  was much more intense in the spectrum obtained by 1977Kh03 and a       
#  weak 1097G was not reported by 1986Wo01. The source collection         
#  procedures were different in 1977Kh03 and 1986Wo01, although both used 
#  mass separation of fragments from neutron fission of 235U.             
#  The recoil-separator method used by 1977Kh03 collected all the         
#  activities of A=100 whereas only the 100RB and 100SR isotopes were     
#  collected in the method used by 1986Wo01. In the former, all isomers   
#  of 100Y (high and low spin) would be observed whereas in the latter    
#  mainly the low spin isomer would be detected since the formation of    
#  100Y was entirely due to 100SR B- decay (GS JPI=0+). It may also be    
#  pointed out that the G-ray spectra shown by 1977Kh03 contain a much    
#  larger number of contaminants than those in the spectra                
#  shown by 1986Wo01.                                                     
#  Existence of isomerism in {+100}Y is confirmed in precision mass       
#  measurements of 2007Ha32.
