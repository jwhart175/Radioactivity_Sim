#  1989Le16,1990Mu06: 20C particles were filtered using magnetic analysis 
#  in the ^LISE spectrometer and identified with energy loss and ToF      
#  measurements. The fragments were implanted in a SI detector surrounded 
#  by a plastic scintillator for |b-ray detection. The target was placed  
#  inside a 4|p neutron detector that had a neutron energy threshold of   
#  350keV. The 20C T1/2 reported in this work was 16 MS +14 -7 and PN= 50 
#  30 was determined; values of T1/2=14 MS +6-5 and PN=72 14, which are   
#  apparently revised, were published in (1990Mu06).                      
#  2003Yo02: 20C ions were produced at the ^RIKEN/^RIPS facility and      
#  implanted a plastic scintillator detector. An array of 13 liquid       
#  scintillator detectors surrounded the implantation target. Following   
#  implantation, |b and |b+n coincidence counting were carried            
#  out for 100 MS (to permit decay of daughter & grandaughter activity).  
#  Standard pulse shape analysis was used to identify high-energy         
#  neutrons, while for 50 KEV LE E{-eq} LE 200 KEV the time of flight     
#  information was used to separate neutrons and |g rays. Analysis of the 
#  1n- and 2n- coincidence events yielded values of ^P{-1n}= 65 +19-18 and
#  ^P{-2n} LT 18.6. T1/2=21.8 MS +15.0-7.4 was also measured.             
#  In summary, T1/2=14 MS +6-5 (1990Mu06) appears most reliable. In       
#  (2003Yo02), limited statistics on 20C were obtained since it was a     
#  contaminant to their beams of interest. The measured ^P{-1n} and       
#  ^P{-2n} values are consistent with the PN values deduced in            
#  (1989Le16,1990Mu06), hence ^P{-1n}=65 +19-18 and ^P{-2n} LT 18.6 are   
#  accepted; this implies %|b-0n AP 35 20. No information on              
#  neutron-emission energies is given, but ^P{-1n}= 65 +19-18 implies that
#  19N{-g.s.} will be fed (by some decay path) in a significant fraction  
#  of decays.
