#  The level scheme and all data are from 1985St02.                       
#  From available data, the decay schemes for the two activities cannot   
#  be separated with confidence. It can only be stated that low-spin      
#  states (J LE 7/2) are most likely populated by the decay of 5.48-min,  
#  (3/2-) activity while the high-spin states are populated by the        
#  4.17-min, (13/2+) activity. Also the normalization factor (IG/100      
#  decays of the parent) cannot be deduced meaningfully since the level   
#  scheme is not considered as well established in view of                
#  energy gap of AP 3.5 MEV between Q=5583 and the highest known level    
#  at 2133 KEV and due to many unplaced |g rays.                          
#  In the earlier NDS for A=199, the two activities were separated        
#  with approximate gamma-ray intensities assigned in the decay of        
#  the low-spin activity. The current evaluator does not believe          
#  that this separation is meaningful in consideration of the             
#  available data                                                         
#            1985St02 suggests that the 845- and 800-KEV gammas may be    
#  present in both 199PO EC decays. However, neither G is shown in        
#  coincidence with any other strong GAMMA, implying considerable direct  
#  feeding in both decays. The 845-KEV G cannot be fed directly in the    
#  13/2+ 199PO EC decay (3rd forbidden EC transition), while in the       
#  GS decay, the EC transition is allowed. It is therefore probable that  
#  most, if not all of the 845G intensity belongs in the 199PO GS decay.  
#  On the other hand, the 880-KEV (7/2)- level cannot be fed directly     
#  from a 3/2- 199PO GS (2nd forbidden BETA transition - allowed          
#  intensity LE E-5 %); nor from 13/2+ 199PO 310-KEV level (2nd           
#  forbidden, unique transition). Thus this level must be fed entirely    
#  by unassigned G's, or the relatively strong 880-KEV M1 GAMMA belongs   
#  somewhere else in the level scheme, making the existence of the        
#  800-KEV 7/2- level questionable.

#G transition (1980Br23 in the energy region 400 - 900 KEV and 1985St02   
#G in the region of 500 - 1000 KEV) in both G and CE spectra. No          
#G obvious candidate was found. However, both found an unassigned         
#G conversion line, which, if CEK in ^Bi, corresponds to EG=667 KEV.      
#G Since this was the strongest unassigned conversion line in the         
#G spectrum, an upper limit could be determined for the isomeric          
#G M4 transition. Thus the %IT was estimated to be LE 2% (1980Br23),      
#G LE 3.2% (1985St02). If the 667G is the isomeric transition with
