#  2011Es03: Source material produced in the {+103}Ru({+58}Ni,|ap)        
#   reaction. Used total-absorption |g spectroscopy to deduce EC+B+       
#   feeding intensities to the 115.2 and 317.5 levels.                    
#  1983Ml01: Source material from 147SM(16O,7N) with E(16O)=141 MeV.      
#   Enriched (98% 147SM) target, followed by isotope separation. |a's     
#   studied using a Si(Au) detector and |g's using a Ge detector. Same    
#   authors as 1982To14.                                                  
#  1999KaZV: Source material produced from high-energy proton spallation  
#   on a tungsten target, followed by on-line isotope separation.         
#   Measured G, GG, CE. Report two |g's, one of which is new.             
#  1982To14: Produced from 147SM(16O,7N), followed by isotope separation. 
#   |g's measured with Ge detectors and |a's with Si(Au) detectors.       
#   One |g, and its EKC, reported. Same authors as 1983Ml01.              
#E           No levels above 317.5 keV are reported in the 156TM decay    
#E   using conventional Ge detector-based |g spectroscopy. From           
#E   total-absorption |g spectroscopy, 2011Es03 report intensities of     
#E   the EC+B+ transitions feeding the 115.2 and 317.5 levels. These      
#E   data give values for these transitions that differ considerably      
#E   from those inferred from the Ge-based spectroscopy, which is not     
#E   unexpected since the level scheme deduced from spectroscopy of this  
#E   sort is expected to be quite incomplete in situations such as this.  
#E   These authors report that (25|+3)% of the decays of 156YB involve    
#E   EC+B+ transitions to levels above 320 keV in 156TM.
