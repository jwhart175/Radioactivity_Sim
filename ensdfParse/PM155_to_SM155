#  DATA SET UPDATED (DECEMBER, 2002) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE BETA-FEEDING  
#   AND RELATED DATA, TOGETHER WITH EXPANDED AND REVISED COMMENTS.        
#  Production: nuclide obtained as a product of spontaneous fission of    
#  252CF. 1982Gr13 carried out rapid chemical separation using            
#  high-performance liquid chromatography and assigned this activity to   
#  155PM based on observation of the grow-in of the 22.3-min 155SM        
#  daughter activity and the agreement between the measured G-ray         
#  energies and those measured by 1982Sc03 in the 154SM(N,G) reaction.    
#  1988GrZY used on-line isotope separation and assigned this activity to 
#  155PM based on its presence in the mass-155 peak and the observation   
#  of the appropriate K X-RAYS.                                           
#  From analysis of total-absorption |g-ray spectra, 1997Gr09 deduce      
#   |b feeding intensities to the excited states of 155SM. These authors  
#   state that these data are consistent with those from their measured   
#   |g spectra, but these latter data remain unpublished.                 
#B IB        From total-absorption |g-ray spectroscopy (1997Gr09).        
#B IB        1997Gr09 REPORT THE FOLLOWING |b FEEDING INTENSITIES TO      
#B  REGIONS OF EXCITATION WHERE NO SPECIFIC LEVELS ARE AS YET IDENTIFIED: 
#B  BETWEEN 1020 AND 1106, 0.42%; BETWEEN 1168 AND 1328, 1.77%;           
#B  AND, ABOVE 1362, 6.9%. THESE VALUES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE LISTING   
#B  OF |b INTENSITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IDENTIFIED LEVELS.              
#B IB(S)     FROM IB=40.7|+2.1% FOR THE SUMMED INTENSITY TO THE FOUR

#L E(Q)      "pseudo-level" INTRODUCED TO ACCOUNT FOR B- FEEDING TO THIS  
#L  REGION OF EXCITATION, WHERE NO INDIVIDUAL LEVELS ARE REPORTED. SEE    
#L  THE COMMENT ON THE IB VALUES. EXCEPT FOR THE HIGHEST SUCH "level",    
#L  THE LISTED VALUE REPRESENTS THE CENTROID OF THE REGION TO WHICH THE   
#L  FEEDING TAKES PLACE. SINCE THIS DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO ANY SPECIFIC   
#L  ACTUAL LEVEL, IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE Adopted Levels.
