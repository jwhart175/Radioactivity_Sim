#  DATA SET REVISED (AUGUST, 2011) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE REVISED QP, E,

#  {+156}Pm has been produced by thermal-neutron induced fission of       
#  {+235}U (1986Ma12,1986Ok01,1990He11) and spontaneous fission of        
#  {+252}Cf (1987Gr12), all with isotope separation. All data reported    
#  here are from 1990He11 or computed by the evaluator. For shorter lists 
#  of |g's, see 1986Ma12, 1986Ok01, and 1987Gr12.                         
#  1990He11: 156SM, from thermal-neutron fission of 235U followed by      
#   isotope separation. Source material collected on a movable tape and   
#   transported to a counting station. Measured multiscaled |g singles    
#   using a large-volume coaxial Ge detector and a ^LEPS detector.        
#   Measured simultaneously low-energy |g's and ce's using the ^LEPS and  
#   an ion-implanted Si detector. System geometry was calibrated using    
#   |g's of known multipolarities from the 124IN decay. Measured GG and   
#   BG(T) coincidences using a small plastic detector and various Ge      
#   detectors. Report EG, RI, Q-, T values for two excited states. The    
#   ce data are not reported in 1990He11, but some of the deduced         
#   multipolarities are given there.

#  1986Ma12: 156PM produced by thermal-neutron induced fission of 235U    
#       with isotope separation.  |g's measured with Ge detectors.        
#  1986Ok01: 156PM produced by thermal-neutron induced fission of 235U    
#       with isotope separation.  |g's measured with Ge detectors.        
#  1987Gr12: 156PM produced by spontaneous fission of 252CF with          
#       isotope separation.  |g's measured with Ge detectors.             
#B           The I|b{+-} values have all been computed from the           
#B  |g-transition intensity balances and therefore are accurate only      
#B  insofar as this decay scheme is correct and complete. There are 3     
#B  unplaced |g rays with intensities of |?0.6% and, since the weakest    
#B  reported |g's have intensities of 0.3%, it is reasonable to expect    
#B  that there are unobserved |g rays with intensites of 0.2% and less.   
#B  With a Q value of 5150 keV and the high spin (J=4) of the parent,     
#B  it is expected that many levels above that at 2699 keV will be        
#B  populated, albeit weakly. Therefore, a minimum uncertainty of 0.4%    
#B  has been assigned to each I|b{+-} by the evaluator.                   
#B           1995Gr19, using total-absorption |g spectroscopy, deduce     
#B  that the |b branching to the ground and first excited states is       
#B  1.8% 17. These authors point out that their data do not provide       
#B  evidence for a nonzero |b- branch to the first excited state.         
#B           The I|b{+-} to the 803 and 1009 levels have been set to zero 
#B  because the adopted J|p requires that these transitions be negligibly 
#B  weak. The values deduced from the intensity balance are 2.0% {I3} and 
#B  2.1% {I8}, respectively.                                              
#G E,RI      From 1990He11. Others: 1986Ok01, 1987Gr12.                   
#G M         Based on I|g and Ice data normalized using transitions of    
#G  known multipolarity in the {+124}In decay. Multipolarities deduced    
#G  from the J|p assignments are omitted if |a<0.01.                      
#L           The level energies are from a least-squares fit to the |g    
#L  energies. There are several cases in which the deduced level-energy   
#L  difference differs from the corresponding |g energy by more than 2    
#L  or 3 times the quoted uncertainty. It is thus reasonable to assume,   
#L  for specific |g lines, that there are doublets and/or that the        
#L  uncertainties are underestimated, possibly due to difficulties in the 
#L  spectral analysis.                                                    
#L E(G)      Suggested member of a band by 1990He11. From LOGFT           
#L  considerations, these authors suggest that |p for the J=3 level is    
#L  most likely the same as that of the 156PM g.s., which these authors   
#L  propose to be negative. 2011So05, however, indicate that this LOGFT   
#L  argument may not be a strong one in this case. Based on the expected  
#L  nucleonic configurations, the evaluator prefers |p=+ for the          
#L  156PM g.s. The sole decay mode of the 2609 level is to a 4+ level,    
#L  consistent with JPI=4-, which is the value listed by 1990He11. In     
#L  that case this and the J=3 level would not be members of the same     
#L  band.                                                                 
#L E(H)      Suggested member of a band by 1990He11. From LOGFT           
#L  considerations, these authors indicate that |p for the J=3 level is   
#L  most likely the same as that of the 156PM g.s., which they propose    
#L  to be negative. However, the evaluator has preferred |p=+ for the     
#L  156PM g.s. The sole decay mode of the 2616 level is to a 4+ level,    
#L  consistent with JPI=4-, which is the value listed by 1990He11. In     
#L  that case this and the J=3 level would not be members of the same     
#L  band.                                                                 
#L J         From the adopted values. These are generally those proposed  
#L  by 1990He11. Where there are differences, these are noted.            
#L BAND(A)   KPI=0+ ground-state band                                     
#L BAND(B)   Probable KPI=1- octupole band.                               
#L  This band likely contains a significant component of                  
#L    |n5/2[642]-|n3/2[521].                                              
#L BAND(D)   Possible 3- member of the KPI=0- octupole band.              
#L  This suggestion is supported by the observation that the |g branching 
#L  from this level to the 2+ and 4+ members of the GS band agrees well   
#L  with the Alaga-rule expectations for DK=0 dipole transitions.         
#L BAND(E)   KPI=5- bandhead, conf=|n5/2[642]+|n5/2[523].                 
#L  This is the dominant conf. See the discussion regarding the 5- state  
#L  at 1515 keV regarding possible configuration mixing between these two 
#L  5- states.                                                            
#L BAND(F)   KPI=5- bandhead, conf=|p5/2[532]+|p5/2[413].                 
#L  The preferential B- feeding of this state relative to the 1397, 5-,   
#L  state suggests that it is predominantly two-proton, rather than       
#L  two-neutron, in character. These two 5- states are, however, most     
#L  likely mixed to some extent. Evidence for such mixing, which is       
#L  frequently observed between two-proton and two-neutron bands with     
#L  the same KPI values, is evidenced by the existence (albeit with a     
#L  sizeable hindrance factor) of the 117-keV M1 transition connecting    
#L  them and the possible, but much weaker, B- feeding of this level.     
#L BAND(J)   Probable KPI=4+ bandhead.
