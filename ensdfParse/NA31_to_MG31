#G $ The following |g-rays with E|g (relative I|g) reported only by       
#G 1979De02 have been omitted here since these have not been confirmed in 
#G later studies (1993Kl02, 1984Gu19): 372.3 10 (2.9 14), 473 1 (8.2 25),

#G E,RI$ Weighted averages of values from 1993Kl02 and 1984Gu19.          
#G The intensities are given by these authors as per 100 decays of the    
#G parent. The weighted average of relative intensities from 1993Kl02 and 
#G 1984Gu19 are given under comments. The conversion factor between       
#G relative and absolute intensities is |?6.5. For branching ratios in    
#G Adopted Gammas, relative intensities are used since these are          
#G more precisely known than the absolute intensities
