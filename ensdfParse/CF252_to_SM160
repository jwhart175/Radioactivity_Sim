#   160SM LEVELS EXCITED IN THE 252CF SF DECAY. MEASURED GG AND GGG COIN  
#   USING AN ARRAY OF 20 Compton-suppressed Ge DETECTORS. GGG COIN        
#   MEASURED USING 36 Ge DETECTORS IN AN EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF          
#   Gammasphere. XG AND XX COIN ALSO MEASURED USING TWO X-RAY DETECTORS   
#   (FWHM=280 eV AT 14 keV) AND THREE Ge DETECTORS. REPORT EG, RI AND     
#   MEMBERS OF THE GS (YRAST) BAND UP THROUGH THE 14+ LEVEL.              
#  THE DATA FROM THE TWO STUDIES ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME, THE ONLY       
#   DIFFERENCES BEING THE EG VALUES (AND, THUS, THE LEVEL ENERGIES).      
#G E         FROM 1997Do20. THESE VALUES DIFFER SOMEWHAT (WITHIN 0.2 T0   
#G  0.4 keV) FROM THOSE OF 1995ZH15.                                      
#G RI        FROM 1995ZH15. 1997Do20 DO NOT REPORT RI VALUES.

#L J         Values assigned by 1995Zh15, based on considerations of      
#L rotational-band structure and the deexcitation characteristics of      
#L the highly excited, high-spin, states produced in the
