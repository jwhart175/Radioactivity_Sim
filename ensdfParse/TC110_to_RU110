#  2000Wa07: Source : {+110}Tc was produced by proton                     
#  induced-fission of {+238}U and was extracted using online-mass         
#  separation technique at Jyvaskyla. A moving tape, 2 plastic            
#  scintillators, 3 Ge detectors and one ^LEPS detector were used.

#  1990Ay02: {+110}Tc was produced by proton induced-fission of {+238}U   
#  and was extracted using online-mass  separation technique at Jyvaskyla.
#  The intensity of the separated {+110}Tc beam was 200 |mC. A moving tape
#  was used to transport the mass-separated beam. Gamma-rays were         
#  detected using 25~% and 20~% Ge detectors. The X-rays and the          
#  low-energy |g-rays were detected by using 1.4 cm{+3} Ge detector. The  
#  |b-rays were observed with a telescope system consisting of a 300      
#  mm{+2}, 500 |mm thick surface barrier |DE detector and a 6 cm thick,   
#  7.5 cm in diameter ^N^E102 plastic E-detector. ELLI spectrometer was   
#  used to measure the internal conversion electrons

#B IB$From intensity balances and the level scheme by the evaluators.     
#B Since the decay scheme suffers from pandemonium, values should be

#B LOGFT$Since the decay scheme is incomplete (pandemonium), the values
