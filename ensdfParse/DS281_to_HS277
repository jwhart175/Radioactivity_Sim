#  2011Ga19 (also 2010Du06): {+281}Ds was produced in                     
#  {+289}Fl -> {+285}Cn -> {+281}Ds |a-decay chain. {+289}Fl was          
#  produced in the reaction {+244}Pu({+48}Ca,3n) described below.         
#  {+48}Ca beam, E=259.4 MeV extracted from an electron cyclotron         
#  resonance (ECR) ion source and accelerated by the universal linear     
#  accelerator (UNILAC) at the GSI. Target=438 |mg/cm{+2} {+244}Pu        
#  enriched to 97.9% purity backed with a 2.22 |mm thick Ti foil. Product 
#  and beam nuclei were separated using the Transactinide Separator and   
#  Chemistry Apparatus (TASCA) based on magnetic rigidity. Evaporation    
#  residues were implanted into the focal plane detector consisting of    
#  two 300 |mm thick double sided silicon strip detectors (DSSSDs) after  
#  passing through a multiwire proportional counter (MWPC). Two single    
#  sided silicon strip detectors (SSSSDs) mounted behind the DSSSDs to    
#  suppress light, low-ionizing particle detection and an additional      
#  eight SSSSDs were mounted upstream in a five-sided box configuration   
#  to detect alpha particles and SF fragments escaping the DSSSDs. A      
#  germanium cluster detector with seven Ge crystals was mounted behind   
#  the Al backplate of the TASCA detection chamber for |a-|g coincidences.
#  Measured EVR-|a, EVR-SF correlations, deduced half life.
