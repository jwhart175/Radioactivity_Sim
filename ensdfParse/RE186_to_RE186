#  1972SE06: sources from 185RE(N,G), chemically purified and aged 0, 4   
#  or 20 years; 4-year old source thicknesses 0.25 and AP 0.025 mg/cm{+2};
#  three GELI detector systems (8 cc, 0.5 cc with FWHM=330 EV at 14 KEV,  
#  20 cc detectors), windowless SILI detector with FWHM AP 1 KEV at 130   
#  KEV; MEASURED ^T{-1/2}, EG, IG, E(ce), I(ce), X-RAY INTENSITIES FOR    
#  ISOMER, AND G AND X-RAY INTENSITIES FOR 186RE(3.7183 D) decay.         
#            The decay scheme is that of 1972Se06. A possible, unobserved 
#  E=3 7 E5 transition connecting the isomer to the known (3)- 146 level, 
#  postulated in 1988Fi06 to explain a small excess in K X-RAY intensity, 
#  has not been adopted; 1972Se06 concluded that the observed I(XK)       
#  could be explained adequately on the basis of conversion of the 99G    
#  alone.

#G M(B)      L2/L3 AP 0.6, L1<<L2 from authors' analysis of RE XLA and    
#G XLB intensity data; L/M AP 1 from I(CE) excess (cf. relative I(CE)     
#G in (N,G)) near 40ce(M) and 59ce(L) peaks (1972Se06). E5 theory         
#G (1978Ba45) is consistent, giving L1:L2:L3:M=0.6:30:31:54 at 43 KEV and 
#G 0.1:44:40:52 at 57 KEV. M5 theory gives L/M AP 1 but L2/L3 AP 0.01;    
#G also, no 8- level is known or expected in adjacent odd-odd isotopes.   
#G Multipolarities with L LT 5 are eliminated because the reduced         
#G transition probability would be less than 6x10{+-6}.                   
#G E(D)      EG GE 11, based on the existence of excess XLB               
#G intensity; also, this |g (feeding the 99 level) presumably deexcites   
#G a state for which E(level) LE 186, otherwise an M2 G to the known (6)- 
#G 186 level would dominate the isomer's decay. Further, 1972Se06         
#G attribute to the L and M lines of this transition the observed I(CE)   
#G excess (cf. relative I(CE) in (N,G)) near the 40ce(M) and              
#G 59ce(L) peak, respectively), implying EG AP 49 and EG AP 50 KEV.       
#G Since 1972Se06 appear to easily resolve peaks which are 7 KEV apart,   
#G the evaluator adopts EG=50 7.

#G           In the above table, the data of 1972Se06 (which were quoted  
#G relative to I(137G, 186OS)=10.0 1 in TABLE 4 of 1972Se06) have been    
#G scaled by the evaluator so I(137G) equals the adopted value of 9.47%.  
#G The resulting intensities were then corrected for unresolved           
#G contributions from W XKB2 and OS XKB1 lines to RE XKB1 and RE XKB2,    
#G respectively, and from W and OS XL to RE XL lines using calculated     
#G intensities for the impurities. It should be noted that uncertainties  
#G from 1972Se06 are statistical only, and that their I(x) data for W and 
#G OS lines from a source with negligible 2E+5 Y RE content are in only   
#G fair agreement with later measurements and with theory; consequently,  
#G the uncertainties given above may be unrealistically small. The column 
#G labeled "Gammas" refers to calculated X-RAY intensity expected due to  
#G the 40-, 59- and 99-KEV transitions; 1972Se06 deduces a much lower,    
#G possibly misprinted value for I(XLA). The column labeled "Difference"  
#G contains the I(x ray) difference between the second and third columns; 
#G this represents the experimental X-RAY intensity associated with the   
#G unobserved isomeric transition. The last column gives calculated       
#G L X-RAY intensities for a 50-KEV E5 transition (based on theoretical   
#G conversion coefficients from 1978Ba45).  If the postulated AP 3-KEV    
#G transition from the isomeric level were to exist, it would be          
#G accompanied by an 87G and a 146G which would increase I(XK) but have   
#G only a minor effect on I(XL).  The discrepancy between observed and    
#G calculated XLA intensity is not understood.
