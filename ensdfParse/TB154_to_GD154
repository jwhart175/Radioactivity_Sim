#  DATA SET UPDATED (APRIL, 2008) BY CW REICH TO INCORPORATE NEW Q VALUE, 
#   CC VALUES FROM BRICC, AND MODIFICATIONS TO SOME COMMENTS.             
#  Three 154TB isomers (21.5, 9.4, and 22.7 H) have been observed. The    
#  most complete decomposition of the G data among these isomers          
#  is from 1975So03, so these data are used to place the G's.             
#  A STUDY OF THE 154TB ISOMERS IS REPORTED AS A PART OF THE THESIS       
#   WHICH CONSTITUTES 2001KuZS. THESE DATA ARE NOT INCLUDED HERE, SINCE   
#   FURTHER ANALYSIS APPEARS TO BE REQUIRED.                              
#  Experimental methods:                                                  
#  See 154TB (21.5 H) for a listing of references.                        
#E TI        Values are from G-transition-intensity balances. Due to      
#E the incompleteness of the decay scheme, values less than 2% are        
#E considered unreliable and are not given. For the same reason,          
#E uncertainties are not given for values less than 5%. All negative      
#E values are omitted. Several values that are incompatible with          
#E the JPI values are also omitted; these are 2% 12 to 4+ at 371 keV,     
#E 2.6% 4 to 2+ at 815, 2.4% 7 to 4+ at 1263, and 10.8% 12 to 4+          
#E at 1645.                                                               
#E TI        As a check of the normalization, it is noted that            
#E SUMOF I(EC+B+) is 94% 10 for the values given, 125% 23 for all         
#E positive values computed. The most meaningful sum may be of the        
#E positive values to states with J GE 5; this sum is 97% 10.             
#E TI        The total-absorption G spectrum of 1980By03 indicates that   
#E for a 154TB source of unstated isomer content, the feeding is          
#E primarily to levels near 2.0 MeV. This measured feeding appears        
#E compatible with any combination of the three 154TB isomers.            
#G E         From weighted average of values of 1972Vy04 and 1975So03.    
#G Values without uncertainties were computed from level energies         
#G by 1975So03.                                                           
#G           RI VALUES ARE NOT GIVEN FOR SEVERAL G'S BY 1975So03. THESE   
#G  G'S ARE KNOWN FROM OTHER STUDIES TO DEEXCITE LEVELS OBSERVED IN THIS  
#G  DECAY, BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS ARE NOT SEEN IN THIS DECAY (1975So03). 
#G E         Because of the more definitive isomer assignment only the    
#G unplaced G's of 1975So03 are given.                                    
#G M,MR      Assignments and values are from 154GD adopted G radiations   
#G and include the results of all types of experiments and all decay      
#G modes. See 154GD adopted G radiations for other information            
#G including: (1) mixing ratios such as MR(M3/E2) and MR(M2/E1)           
#G where MR can be zero and is not included here; (2) comments on         
#G measurements for lines which are multiplets; and (3)                   
#G identification of CC values that are based on                          
#G experimental values rather than theory.
