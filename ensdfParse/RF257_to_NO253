#  1997He29: {+257}Rf produced through the {+208}Pb({+50}Ti,n) reaction.  
#  {+50}Ti beam produced by an electron cyclotron resonance source and    
#  accelerated to E=233 MeV by the ATLAS accelerator at Argonne National  
#  Laboratory. The evaporation residues were separated from unreacted     
#  beam particles by the Argonne Fragment Mass Analyzer. Particles and    
#  their decay products were detected using a parallel grid avalanche     
#  counter (PGAC) and a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD).       
#  Time-of-flight measurements were taken between the PGAC and the DSSD.  
#  Two high-purity germanium detectors and two low-energy photon          
#  spectrometers were used to measure |g's. Measured |g spectra, |a       
#  spectra, conversion electrons, fission-like events and half-lives.     
#  Deduced isomer, Nilsson configurations.                                
#  The placements of the |a groups is by 2009Qi04.
