# 98MODCG of 787G to 743G (in 97NB from 97ZR and 97NB IT DECAY). The absolute    
#G of 787G to 743G (in 97NB from 97ZR and 97NB IT DECAY). The absolute    
#G intensity of 735 transition was determined from ICE(735) and           
#G integrated BETA spectrum for 98NB. 1969HU07 measured absolute          
#G intensities of both transitions with BETA and GAMMA detectors          
#G of calibrated efficiencies. The results from 1987MA58 are considered   
#G more reliable but differ by a factor of AP 4 from those by 1976HE10    
#G and 1969HU07. The ratio ICE(854,E0 in 98ZR from 98Y decay)/ICE(735,    
#G E0 in 98MO from 98NB decay) were also measured by 1983VAZQ             
#G in 232TH(A,F) and 238U(A,F) reactions and by 1971FO21 from             
#G fission of 235U and 239PU
