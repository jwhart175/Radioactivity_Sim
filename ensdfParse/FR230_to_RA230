#  Modified by E. Browne (May 31, 2007).                                  
#  The 230FR B- decay scheme is presented as given in                     
#  1987Ku04 based on coincidence data and G-ray energy adjustments        
#  between levels. Forty six G rays have not been placed in the decay     
#  scheme. Although a number of them can be placed by considering         
#  differences between G-ray energies (see table below), since            
#  coincidence data are not available, such placements could not          
#  be confirmed; thus these transitions have been left unplaced           
#  in the decay scheme.                                                   
#  The sum of photon intensities of unplaced transitions                  
#  is 203 43 (relative to I(129.1G)=100) which amounts to                 
#  22 5 percent of B- decay, when the normalization factor                
#  of 0.114 is used.                                                      
#  If J(230FR)=3, as suggested by 1987Ku04 (from apparent BETA            
#  feedings to the 2+, 4+ states in 230RA), G-ray intensity imbalances    
#  at 6+, 5+ (or 5-), and 1- levels suggest that these levels must        
#  be populated by additional G rays from higher-energy levels. Besides   
#  the unplaced G rays, some additional (not yet observed)                
#  low-energy and highly converted G-ray transitions between rotational   
#  band states could also affect the BETA feedings that the present       
#  decay scheme yields.                                                   
#  No B- delayed fission from 230FR decay (LT 3E-4%) (1990Me13).
