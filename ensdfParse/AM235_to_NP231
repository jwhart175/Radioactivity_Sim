#  {+235}Am isotope was produced in the {+233}U({+6}Li,4n) reaction at    
#  E=34-42 MeV.  Reaction products stopped in He gas loaded with PbI{-2}  
#  clusters, and transported into an ion source of ISOL by gas-jet stream.
#  Products mass separated.                                               
#  Measured E|a, I|a, |g|a coin with a Si PIN photodiode detector         
#  contained in a thin vacuum chamber with separate Be and Al windows.    
#  Positioned behind the Be window was a short coaxial Ge detector (ORTEC 
#  LOAX) to detect low-energy |g-rays, while an n-type Ge detector        
#  was placed behind the Al window which detected |g-rays from            
#  implanted nuclei through the Si wafer of the PIN detector              
#G RI$Determined from both singles and coincidence |g-ray spectra. The    
#G large uncertainties are due to low statistics and poor                 
#G peak-to-background ratios.
