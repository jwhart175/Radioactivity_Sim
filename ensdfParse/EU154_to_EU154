#  1975Ca22:  Produced by (p,n) on enriched (99.996%) {+154}Sm with       
#      E(p)=11 MeV. Measured |g singles and |g|g coincidences with        
#      Ge detectors.                                                      
#  1976Ch08:  Produced by (p,n) on enriched (99.996%) {+154}Sm with       
#      E(p)=12.5 MeV followed by chemical separation. Measured |g's       
#      with Ge detectors and ce in magnetic spectrometer.                 
#  1976Zo01:  Produced by (p,n), (d,2n), (d,|a), and (d,p); some          
#      followed by chemical separations. Measured |g singles and |g|g     
#      coincidences with Ge detectors. Si(Li) detector used in search     
#      for the isomeric transition.                                       
#G           The |g transition which deexcites the isomeric level has     
#G     not been observed; and two other unobserved |g transitions are     
#G     proposed to provide feeding of the 127 and 129 levels.             
#G E         From 1976Zo01. These values have the smallest                
#G      uncertainties, so a weighted average of these values with those   
#G      of 1975Ca22 and 1976Ch08 would give essentially the same values.  
#G      For most |g's, more precise energies are given in the Adopted     
#G      |g Radiations.                                                    
#G RI        From 1976Ch08, unless otherwise noted. The evaluators have   
#G      increased the uncertainties by factors of 2.0 above 30 keV and    
#G      4.0 below 30 keV to allow for the large discrepancy between       
#G      the values from 1975Ca22, 1976Ch08, and 1976Zo01. The             
#G      discrepancies among the reported data are illustrated by the      
#G      fact that, for the three |g's below 34 keV, the reported          
#G      uncertainties are about 10%, but the values vary by factors       
#G      of 2 or more.                                                     
#G M,MR      Assignments and values are from Adopted |g Radiations.       
#L           Although the observed |g rays are similar, the decay         
#L     schemes of 1975Ca22, 1976Ch08, and 1976Zo01 are quite different.   
#L     The scheme adopted here is that of the evaluators and is based     
#L     on the level structure from the {+153}Eu(n,|g) study of 1987Ba52.  
#L     The scheme adopted in previous ENSDF evaluations                   
#L     (1979Ha02 and 1987He20) was similar to that of 1976Zo01, which     
#L     relied on certain data from the (n,|g) study of 1977St14. This     
#L     study differs in important ways from that of 1987Ba52.             
#L E         Computed from these |g energies, unless otherwise noted;     
#L      for more precise values, see the Adopted Levels.                  
#L J         From {+154}Eu Adopted Levels, where the band assignments     
#L      are also discussed.                                               
#L T         Values included here for excited states are from {+154}Eu    
#L      (46.0 min) decay only; see Adopted Levels for values deduced      
#L      from all available data.
