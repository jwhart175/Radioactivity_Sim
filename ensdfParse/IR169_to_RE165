#  2012Th13: {+169}Ir from |a-decay of {+173}Au, where                    
#  {+173}Au nuclei were produced by bombarding a 0.5 mg/cm{+2} {+92}Mo    
#  target of 97% enrichment with a beam of {+84}Sr{+16+} ions from the    
#  k130 cyclotron of the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of      
#  Jyv~askyl~a. Recoiling residues were separated using the RITU He-filled
#  magnetic separator and traversed an isobutane-filled multiwire         
#  proportional chamber (MWPC) and implanted into a 300-|mm-thick DSSD in 
#  the GREAT spectrometer. Measured E|a, I|a, recoil-|a-correlation,
