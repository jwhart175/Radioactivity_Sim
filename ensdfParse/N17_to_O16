#  Foreword:                                                              
#  The measurements of |b-delayed neutrons from {+17}N                    
#  decay are relatively consistent in both the energies and relative      
#  intensities of neutron groups. Most efforts did not determine the      
#  absolute feeding intensities to neutron groups, but rather the         
#  relative intensities of neutron groups are deduced. The determination  
#  of "absolute" intensities relies on a renormalization using an         
#  assumption of %|b-n=100-(4.66 {I75}))=(95.34 {I75})% (feeding to       
#  neutron bound states).                                                 
#  1964Si06: {+17}N activity was produced in thin-walled cells comprised  
#  of either aluminium or stainless steel using the {+15}N(t,p)           
#  reaction. A NaI detector observed the |g-ray spectrum obtained         
#  in measurements on the stainless steel cell; transitions at E{-|g}=    
#  870 and 2190 keV were observed with a relative ratio=(6.8 {I9}):1.0.   
#  Since the 2190 transition corresponds to a cascade from {+17}O*(3055)  
#  to {+17}O*(870), the relative feeding of the first and second excited  
#  states is (5.8 {I9}):1.0 . Care was taken to minimize contributions    
#  from n+p capture that could interfere with the E{-|g}=2190 keV         
#  analysis. No other |g-rays were observed; in particular transitions    
#  from {+17}O*(3843:J|p=5/2-) and transitions in {+16}O were not         
#  observed.                                                              
#  The measurements on the aluminium cell were analyzed to obtain the     
#  singles |b-ray spectrum and the |b-ray plus |g-ray coincidence         
#  spectrum. The part of the singles spectrum that extended above the     
#  coincidence spectrum was analyzed to obtain the ratio of feeding to    
#  {+17}O*(870) relative to feeding to the {+17}O{-g.s.}=(1.7 {I4}):1.0.  
#  Lastly, the beta spectrum was analyzed to determine the feeding |b-ray 
#  intensity to {+17}O*(0,870,3055) relative to the total |b-ray          
#  intensity. These decay branches correspond to (4.66 {I75})% of all     
#  decays.                                                                
#  Hence the calculated branching fractions are                           
#  (1.55 {I47})% to {+17}O{-g.s.},                                        
#  (2.64 {I47})% to {+17}O*(870),                                         
#  (0.46 {I11})% to {+17}O*(3055).                                        
#  Furthermore, the lack of feeding to {+17}O*(3843:J|p=5/2-) is          
#  evidence for assigning J|p=1/2- to {+17}N{-g.s.}.                      
#  1973De32: {+17}N ions were produced by bombarding 88% enriched {+14}C  
#  target which was on a thick tungsten backing with 27-MeV |a-particles. 
#  The neutrons were detected with a {+3}He filled proportional counter.  
#  Three neutron groups at E{-n}=390 {I16}, 1190 {I30} and 1710 {I40} keV 
#  emitted from {+17}O*(4.55,5.09,5.94 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} with         
#  branching ratios of 27% {I3}, 57% {I4} and 11% {I2}, respectively.     
#  Relative neutron branching ratios are measured, which are normalized   
#  to the accepted %|b-n rate of 95%. From the neutron counts in the      
#  1.9-2.6 MeV region an upper limit, < 0.4%, is set for the branches     
#  emitted from {+17}O*(6.1-6.8) to {+16}O{-g.s.}.                        
#  1973Po11: {+17}N |b{+-}-decay activity was produced by bombarding      
#  enriched {+15}N{-2} gas (95-99% {+15}N) using a 2.9-MeV triton beam.   
#  The beam was chopped and had 4 second activation and counting periods. 
#  The |b activity was detected by a NE102 detector, the |g-decay         
#  activity was detected via a 15.2 cm by 12.7 cm NaI detector. The       
#  neutron activity was initially measured using a NE102 disk, though     
#  issues with high backgrounds at low-energies led to additional         
#  measurements using a {+3}He proportional counter. The |b-n and |b-|g   
#  coincidences were measured; there is no mention of n-|g coincidences,  
#  therefore neutron decays are assumed to populate 16O{-g.s.}.           
#  Neutron peaks at 385 {I4}, 1163 {I14} and 1675 {I24} keV were observed 
#  corresponding to decays from {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94) to {+16}O{-g.s.}, 
#  respectively. The relative ratios for decay branches were determined,  
#  and then the absolute branching ratios were determined by a            
#  self-consistent renormalization. The feeding to the {+17}O{-g.s.}      
#  relative to {+17}O*(870) was taken from (1964Si06) (=(1.7 {I4}):1.0);  
#  other ratios, relative to the E{-n}=1.16 MeV group intensity, were     
#  determined. The absolute branching ratios were determined as           
#  BR=(1.7 {I5})% to {+17}O{-g.s.}, (2.9 {I5})% to {+17}O*(870),          
#  (0.54 {I8})% to {+17}O*(3060), (37.9% {I18}) to {+17}O*(4550),         
#  (51.1% {I15}) to {+17}O*(5380), and (5.8% {I6}) to {+17}O*(5940). The  
#  total feeding to bound {+17}O levels was found to be (5.14 {I72})%.    
#  1976Al02: {+17}N ions were produced in the {+15}N(t,p) reaction by     
#  bombarding a Ti{+15}N target with 3.0-MeV tritons. The target was      
#  irradiated for 4 sec, followed by a 4 sec counting period.             
#  The |g-ray activity was measured using a Ge(Li) detector. Energies for 
#  the {+17}O first and second excited states were determined as 870.8 keV
#  {I2} and 3055.2 keV {I3}, and the ratio of the |g ray intensities was  
#  measured as 1:(9.6 {I4}). This ratio is significanly different from    
#  prior results and is attributed to the ability to resolve the          
#  E{-|g}=2190 keV transition from the E{-|g}=2223 keV peak from thermal  
#  neutron capture on hydrogen.  No attempt to measure the ground-state   
#  branch was made, and hence the values for branching to {+17}O{-g.s.}   
#  and {+17}O bound levels was taken from (1964Si06). The branching ratios
#  were found as (1.6 {I5})% to {+17}O{-g.s.}, (3.0 {I5})% to             
#  {+17}O*(870), (0.34 {I6})% to {+17}O*(3055).                           
#  Delayed neutrons were measured using a {+3}He neutron detector; peaks  
#  at E{-n}=390, 1160 and 1690 keV were observed. Taking the sum of |b    
#  branches to neutron-stable level in {+17}O as (4.9 {I7})%, the         
#  branching ratios from {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} are 
#  found as 39.2% {I20}, 48.0% {I15} and 7.9% {I7}, respectively.         
#  1976Oh05: {+17}N |b-decay activity was produced via the                
#  {+6}Li(n,|a){+3}H and {+18}O({+3}H,|a){+17}N reactions by              
#  placing an enriched {+6}Li{-2}C{+18}O{-3} target (|> 95% {+6}Li, 93.4% 
#  {+18}O) in a reactor and utilizing a fast pneumatic tube system to     
#  transfer the sample between activation and counting stations. The      
#  {+17}N neutron decay curve was measured with eight {+3}He proportional 
#  counters surrounded by paraffin. Four peaks at E{-n}=382.8 {I9}, 884   
#  {I21} (new identified), 1170.9 {I8} and 1700.3 {I17} keV were measured 
#  with |G=54.8 {I4}, 113 {I55}, 63.2 {I11} and 60.5 {I32} keV,           
#  respectively. Normalization of the neutron emission probabilities to   
#  P{-n}=95% {I1} from (1964Si06), yields the |b{+-}n branching ratios    
#  from {+17}O*(4.55,5.08,5.39,5.95 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} as, 34.8% {I26},
#  0.6% {I4}, 52.7% {I35} and 7.0% {I5}, respectively.                    
#  In addition, T{-1/2}=4.174 s {I4} was measured.                        
#  1984In01: The neutron spectrum of activated cooling water from the     
#  SLAC beam dump was analyzed using a {+3}He spectrometer. The activity  
#  is presumably from the {+18}O(|g,p){+17}N reaction. In addition to     
#  strong neutron lines at E{-n}=383, 1170 and 1700 keV a significantly   
#  weaker group at E{-n}=2070 keV is suggested. This group has not been   
#  reported in other work.                                                
#  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MEV proton bombardment of a     
#  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
#  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
#  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
#  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderate {+3}He 
#  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
#  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
#  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
#  detected in the zero-threshold counter. The |b-delayed neutron         
#  probability P{-n}=(102.4 {I60})% was deduced.                          
#  1996Ra02,2003Mi01: In these experiments, authors observed              
#  {+17}N(|b{+-}n) decay to calibrate the neutron energy and the neutron  
#  counters. Neutron peaks at 380, 1170 and 1700 keV were observed.       
#  The branching ratios of corresponding emissions from                   
#  {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94) to {+16}O{-g.s.} normalized to 95% {I1} are    
#  39.5% {I46}, 49.1% {I46} and 6.4% {I10}, respectively (1996Ra02).      
#  A fourth known peak at E{-n}=880 keV was too weak to be observed.      
#  2000Bu33,2001Gr06: A {+17}N beam was produced by fragmenting a 77 MeV/A
#  {+18}O beam on a Be target; {+17}N was selected by the                 
#  LISE3 spectrometer. Neutron time-of-flight (TOF) and energy spectra    
#  were obtained using the TONNERRE array which covered 45% of 4|p. The   
#  intrinsic efficiency is rather high between 1 and 5 MeV. Neutron       
#  groups at E{-n}=380, 1170 and 1710 keV were observed. Intensities are  
#  not analyzed.                                                          
#  Comments:                                                              
#  For the population of bound {+17}O states, the |b-ray energy spectrum  
#  analysis of (1964Si06) [BR({+17}O*(0,870,3055)){-total}=(4.66 {I75})   
#  and R=(1:(1.7 {I4}) for |b-decay to {+17}O{-g.s.} vs decay to          
#  {+17}O*(870)] are combined with R=(9.6 {I4}):1 for the relative        
#  intensities of E{-|g}=870 and 2170 keV |g-rays from (1976Al02).        
#  The data on decay feedings to bound states in {+17}O is sparse;        
#  measurements are found in (1964Si06,1973Po11,1976Al02). The only       
#  complete measurement on the decay populating {+17}O bound states is    
#  found in (1964Si06); along with studying the |g radiations with a NaI  
#  detector, they analyzed the |b radiations. In (1964Si06) the ratio of  
#  the |b-decay to {+17}O{-g.s.} relative to feeding of {+17}O*(870) is   
#  determined as 1:(1.7 {I4}); there is no other comparible measurement.  
#  Further analysis of the |b-ray spectrum determined that the bound      
#  {+17}O*(0,870,3055) states are populated in (4.66 {I75})% of decays.   
#  In (1973Po11), use of the (1964Si06) ground state result, along with   
#  analysis of their NaI data results in finding the branching ratio to   
#  {+17}O*(0,870,3055) as (5.14 {I72})%, but, as mentioned below, it is   
#  suggested that the E{-|g}=2170 keV intensity is enlarged by a          
#  systematic error associated with contributions from n+p capture. In    
#  (1973Po11) one finds the only reported connection between any neutron  
#  group intensity and a |g-ray transition intensity:                     
#  I(|g{-870 keV})/I(E{-n}=1.16 MeV)=(0.0667 {I95}).                      
#  In (1976Al02) the value R=(9.6 {I4}):1 for the relative                
#  intensities of E{-|g}=870 and 2170 keV |g-rays is found; they suggest  
#  the results of (1964Si06,1973Po11) are unreliable because neither      
#  group could resolve n+p capture |g rays from the 2170 keV decay        
#  transition; in spite of great caution described in those works this    
#  uncertainty discounts their E{-|g}=2170 keV intensities.               
#                                                                         
#  In all cases, the neutron group branching ratios are based on          
#  relative intensity measurements that are normalized to unity with      
#  inclusion of feedings to {+17}O bound states.                          
#  There are discrepancies among the relative intensities reported in     
#  (1973De32,1973Po11,1976Al02,1976Oh05,1996Ra02). In the present analysis
#  all measurements are considered; the results of (1973De32) appear to   
#  deviate significantly from other measurements and are excluded from    
#  analysis. The mean intensities from the remaining four measurements are
#  determined, and these intensities are renormalized to yield
