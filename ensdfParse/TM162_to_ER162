#  2002Ca35: STUDIED THE DECAY OF THE 162TM GS, FROM THE DECAY OF 162YB,

#E E         The measured B+ energies are from 1963Ab02, 1974De47, and    
#E 1975St12. From 1963Ab02, E(B+)=3820 50 for the singles endpoint, which 
#E is probably influenced by the branches to the levels at 0 and 102 keV  
#E and corresponds to Q+ AP 4890. From 1974De47, E(B+)=2075 150 and       
#E 2115 80 for the branch to 1573 level. (These two gating G peaks are    
#E doublets, but the corrections should be small.) This corresponds to    
#E Q+=4705 70. From 1975St12, E(B+)=3500 300 for the branch to the 102    
#E level, which corresponds to Q+=4600 300.                               
#E IB        From measurements of 1974De47.                               
#E TI        From measured IB+ and theoretical B+/capture ratios. As      
#E noted by 1974De47, the I(EC+B+) values computed from G-intensity       
#E balances are inaccurate. This is due to the fact that the unplaced     
#E G's have a total intensity of 13% and that there may be many           
#E unobserved G's underlying the observed peaks and Compton distribution. 
#E This argument is supported by the total-absorption G measurements of   
#E 1982By03, as indicated in the next comment. The data of 1974De47 and   
#E 1982By03, together with the G-intensity balances, are compared in the  
#E following comment and comments associated with some individual levels. 
#E TI        The total-absorption G measurements of 1982By03 give the     
#E following results (the energies of the associated levels are the       
#E evaluator's interpretation): 4% feeding of ground state and 102        
#E level (compared to 4 to 6.5% in this scheme and 31% from               
#E G-intensity balances); 10% feeding for levels between 0.9 and          
#E 2 MeV (compared to AP 11.5% given in this scheme and 45% from          
#E from G-intensity balances); 32% feeding for levels from 2 to 3         
#E MeV (compared to 0% shown in this scheme and 10% from G-intensity      
#E balances); 50% feeding from 3 to 4 MeV (compared to 0% shown in        
#E this scheme and 12% from G-intensity balances); and 4% feeding         
#E above 4 MeV (compared to 0% since there are no levels in this          
#E scheme in this region).
