#  2005Ca02: Projectile fragmentation of {+208}Pb beam at 1 GeV on        
#  1.6 g/CM2 thick 9BE target. Fragment Recoil Separator (^FRS) was used  
#  to identify {+202}Pt residues. Measured: E|g, I|g, and |g|g, |g|g(t);  
#  Detectors: four "Clover" type Ge detectors (providing 16 independent   
#  Ge crystals). The experimental setup also included two multi-wire      
#  proportional counters for position measurements; two scintillation     
#  detectors, providing time-of-flight                                    
#  and position information; and a further two scintillators and an       
#  ionization chamber (MUSIC) for energy loss measurements.  For each Ge  
#  crystal, the energy and time of the first |g-ray event was recorded    
#  after the arrival of a heavy ion, up to a maximum time of 75 |ms.      
#G E(A)$534.9G was suggested as a doublet by the authors,                 
#G based on the relatively large width and intensity.                     
#G RI$Relative |g-ray intensity for transitions observed within the 75    
#G |ms time window.                                                       
#G RI(A)$Doublets, undivided intensity is given.                          
#L E$From a least-square fit to EG.                                       
#L J$From 2005CA02, based on the systematics of
