#  2004DE40: 93RH source from 58NI(40AR{+11+},P4N), E=171 MEV AT TARGET   
#  FACE (AFTER DEGRADATION OF 250 MEV BEAM USING Ta foils); 99.93% 58NI   
#  TARGET; RECOILS WERE stopped and neutralized in 500 mbar of purified Ar
#  GAS BEFORE BEING ionized selectively (according to Z) using two dye    
#  lasers tuned to the resonant atomic transitions of Rh TO ENHANCE       
#  ionization, and thus extraction; laser-ionized nuclei guided           
#  towards the ^LISOL mass separator by a sextupole ion guide, THEN       
#  IMPLANTED ONTO MOVABLE TAPE; |b-SENSITIVE PLASTIC DE DETECTORS; 2 HPGe 
#  DETECTORS; measured EG, IG, GG COIN, |b|g coin, IB, isotope ^T{-1/2}   
#  No evidence (NEITHER THE ^IT NOR ANY |b-delayed |g EVENTS) was found   
#  by 2004De40 for the presence of the known (1976DE37) ^T{-1/2}=10.8 S,  
#  1/2- isomer IN 93RU.                                                   
#E TI         ABSOLUTE INTENSITY DETERMINED BY 2004DE40 FROM I(G+-) AFTER 
#E CORRECTION FOR CONTRIBUTION FROM DECAY OF THE 93RU ISOBAR.  All I(G+-) 
#E not associated with G events visible in the |g-ray spectra were        
#E attributed to the GS branch.  Consequently, this branch may be         
#E overestimated because it will incorporate branching to states          
#E whose deexciting G-RAYS are too weak or too energetic (>4 MEV) to      
#E have been detected in this experiment.  Also, the existence of such    
#E transitions may result in an under-estimation of branching to          
#E some excited states.                                                   
#E LOGFT     Values should probably be regarded as lower limits because   
#E the large Q value                                                      
#E suggests the possibility of significant unobserved feeding to highly   
#E excited states which subsequently decay to low-lying levels. Weakly    
#E populated states and branching to states producing |g-rays outside the 
#E 4 MEV |g-energy range may be wrongly attributed to ground-state decay. 
#E A further consequence may be that apparently-forbidden |b decays may   
#E result from G transitions from higher-lying levels fed by allowed EC   
#E transitions.
