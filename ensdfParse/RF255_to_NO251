#  2006He27: {+255}Rf isotope produced by the {+207}Pb({+50}Ti,2n)        
#  reaction at E=4.85 MeV/nucleon.                                        
#  Reaction products were separated from the primary                      
#  beam by the SHIP velocity filter at GSI facility and implanted into a  
#  position-sensitive 16-strip PIPS detector.                             
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |a-|g coin, ce, lifetimes with a 'clover'     
#  HPGe detector (composite of four Ge crystals).

#A E$ Although several weak |a groups have been reported in 2006He27 and  
#A in earlier studies (2001He35,1997He29), the fine structure of          
#A |a particle decay of {+255}Rf remains tentative for the following      
#A reasons: 1. |a energies can populate levels from which the transitions 
#A are highly converted and the electron lines can sum up with the        
#A |a lines; 2. some |a-particles  escape the stop detector. Their energy 
#A loss in the stop detector produces a tail of the |a line towards lower 
#A energies 3. radiation damage of the detectors                          
#A gives rise to statistical fluctuations in the |a spectrum. See 2006He27
#A for greater details. Some weak |a groups are individually discussed.   
#A Weak lines at 8692, 8773, 8797, 8831 and 8897 are all assigned by      
#A 2001He35 as sum lines (|a+ce).                                         
#A E$ Three types of uncertainties are combined in quadrature:            
#A statistical uncertainty of 4-8 keV; systematic uncertainty of 15 keV   
#A from calibration methods/standards; uncertainty of 3 keV due to        
#A reproducibility of an |a peak energy.
