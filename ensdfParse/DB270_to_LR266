#  First identification of {+266}Lr nuclide; and first report on          
#  the |a decay mode of {+270}Db                                          
#  {+270}Db from |a decay chain: {+294}117 --> {+290}115 --> {+286}113 -->
#  {+282}Rg --> {+278}Mt --> {+274}Bh --> {+270}Db --> {+266}Lr; {+294}117
#  formed and identified in reaction {+249}Bk({+48}Ca,3n),E=252.1, 254.0, 
#  258.0 MeV. Four events were assigned to the decay of {+294}117.        
#  See details in 2014Kh04                                                
#  Facility: accelerator complex at GSI. Gas-filled Trans-Actinide        
#  Separator and Chemistry Apparatus (TASCA) at GSI.                      
#  Detection system: TASCA consisted of multiwire proportional counter    
#  (MWPC), and a focal plane detector box containing double-sided silicon 
#  strip detectors (DSSSDs).                                              
#  Measured position and time correlations between evaporation residues   
#  (Er), |a, and SF events, E|a, half-lives, Er-|a-|a, and Er-|a-|a-SF    
#  correlations.
