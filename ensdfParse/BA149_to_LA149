#  A radioactive beam of mass A=149 was produced by thermal-neutron-      
#  induced fission of a {+235}U target, which consisted of about 1 g      
#  of uranium dispersed in graphite, at T=2300|'.                         
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|g(|q) with two Compton-suppressed NORDBALL 
#  Ge spectrometers.  Low-energy photons were measured with a high-purity 
#  X-ray detector (LEP). The |g|g coincidence events were performed in a  
#  second measurement in which the BGO shields of both Ge detectors had   
#  been removed. Transitions belonging to {+149}Ba decay were identified  
#  on the basis of coincidences with the x rays of La and |g|g            
#  coincidences.
