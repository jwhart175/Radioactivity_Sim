# 28NA2C  12280 keV {I10} obtained from 28NE B- DECAY ^Q(g.s.) and branching.    
#  12280 keV {I10} obtained from 28NE B- DECAY ^Q(g.s.) and branching.    
#  2006TR02,2005TR05: 28NE isotope was produced from fragmentation of 48CA
#  beam on a Be target, E=140 MeV/nucleon at ^NSCL; Fragments were        
#  separated by ^A1900 fragment separator and identified by energy loss in
#  a DE-E detector and time of flight; Detector: double sided Si          
#  microstrip detector (^DSSD), ^SeGA array of 12 HPGe detectors, B-      
#  counting system (BCS); Measured EG, EB, RI, IB, B-GG coin.             
#  1999Re16: 28NE was produced by TA(36S,X), E(36S)=2.8 GEV, reaction;    
#  Magnetic Spectrometer (^LISE3); nuclides were identified by ^TOF and   
#  energy loss in Si; Detector: 6 Si, 4 HPGe and 42 3HE proportional      
#  counters; Measured: EG, RI, BG COIN, T, B-N.                           
#  All data are from 2006Tr02, unless otherwise stated                    
#B IB$From G-ray intensity balance to each level and the total number of  
#B B-correlated decay events obtained from a fit to decay curves          
#B (2006Tr02).                                                            
#G RI$Based on a private communication (via e-mail) between ^XUNDL        
#G compiler and V. Tripathi, dated May 9, 2006.                           
#L E$From a least-squares fit to G-ray energies, DE{-|g}=1 keV is assumed
