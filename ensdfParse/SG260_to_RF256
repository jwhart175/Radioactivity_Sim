#  {+260}Sg assignment: {+207}Pb({+54}Cr,n), {+208}Pb({+54}Cr,2n); parent 
#  of {+256}Rf (1984De07,1984Og03,1985Mu11)                               
#  1985Mu11: measured E|a, I|a, half-life                                 
#  2009He20: {+260}Sg produced in the {+208}Pb({+54}Cr,2n) and            
#  {+207}Pb({+54}Cr,n) reactions with the {+54}Cr beam delivered by the   
#  charge state injector of the UNILAC accelerator at GSI Darmstadt.      
#  Evaporation residues were separated by the velocity filter SHIP and    
#  implanted into a 16-strip Si PIPS detector. A box of six Si-wafers was 
#  used to measure escaping |a-particles. A Ge clover detector consisting 
#  of four crystals was used to measure |g rays in coincidence with       
#  particles. Measured E|a, E|g, half-lives, |s.                          
#  Q(|a)({+260}Sg)=9923 {I30} is recommended by 1995Au04 which is         
#  calculated from E|a(to {+256}Rf g.s.)=9770 {I30}.                      
#  %|a=50 {I+20-30} was obtained by 1985Mu11.                             
#  When |a branching of 50% is used, r{-0}({+256}Rf)=1.486 is calculated  
#  from HF(9770|a)=1.0. This r{-0} parameter is larger than the           
#  expected r{-0} of 1.465 {I20}, obtained from the trend of r{-0} values 
#  given in 1998Ak04.                                                     
#  Calculations by using r{-0}=1.465 {I20} yield 12 ms {I+6-5} for        
#  partial |a of half-life of {+260}Sg, corresponding to %|a=30           
#  {I+20-10} [T{-1/2}({+260}Sg)=3.6 {I9} ms is used]. See '{+260}Sg
