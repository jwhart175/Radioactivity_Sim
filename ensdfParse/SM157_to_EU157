#  For these decay scheme studies, {+157}Sm has been produced by the      
#       {+160}Gd(n,|a) reaction, n fission of {+235}U with isotope        
#       separation, and spontaneous fission of {+252}Cf with chemical     
#       separation.  Measurements have included |g singles and            
#       |g|g-coincidence spectra with Ge detectors, |b- spectra with      
#       plastic and anthracene detectors, and |g|b- coincidences.

#  1960Wi10: Produced by {+160}Gd(n,|a), but T{-1/2} reported as 0.5      
#       min {I1}, so isotope probably misassigned.

#  1997Gr09: Produced from {+252}Cf spontaneous fission with isotope      
#       separation.  Measured |b- branch intensity as a function of the   
#       excited level energy with total absorption |g-ray spectrometer.   
#B IB        Relative values are from |g-ray intensity balances for       
#B      levels with deexciting |g's, except for the 76 level.  These      
#B      values are converted to absolute values by including the values   
#B      from the total absorption |g spectra, TAGS, for the ground        
#B      state (1996Gr20) and the pseudolevels (1997Gr09).  The values     
#B      from the intensity balances and TAGS data are in good agreement.  
#B IB        The |b- intensity distribution from the total                
#B      absorption |g spectra (TAGS) (1997Gr09) indicate that             
#B      |? 9.4% of the decays are to levels that are not in the |g-ray    
#B      decay scheme, namely, |? 850, 1050 - 1250, and above 1500 keV.    
#B      These decays are represented here by pseudolevels which do not    
#B      have any depopulating |g's.  These pseudolevels represent the     
#B      sum of the |b- feeding to all the actual levels in an energy      
#B      range.  Where the pseudolevels are adjacent, this range is half   
#B      of the distance between the adjacent levels; and where a          
#B      pseudolevel is between discrete levels, the range is between      
#B      these levels.                                                     
#B      No uncertainties are included for the I{-|b-} to the              
#B      pseudolevels, and no log {Ift}'s are given since this intensity   
#B      is expected to be distributed over several actual levels.         
#B IB,LOGFT$The inability to include the unknown |g decays from the       
#B      upper levels will, in principle, cause the I{-|b-} values         
#B      deduced from the |g intensity balances to be incorrect; however,  
#B      since most of these unknown |g's are expected to populate the     
#B      strongly fed levels                                               
#B      below 460 keV, the changes in the log {Ift} values are probably   
#B      small. The uncertainties in the I{-|b-} and log {Ift}'s do not    
#B      include any contributions from the incompleteness of the decay    
#B      scheme.
