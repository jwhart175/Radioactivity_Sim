#  2013La11: {+9}Be({+136}Xe,X),({+238}U,F),E=750 MeV/nucleon beams of    
#  {+136}Xe from GSI, SIS-18 synchrotron. Targets=1 and 4 g/cm{+2} {+9}Be.
#  Detectors: FRS, ionization chambers, multiwire chambers, scintillation 
#  detectors, RISING multidetector array comprising 105 HPGe detectors,   
#  mounted in 15 composite Cluster detectors without antiCompton shields. 
#  Measured TOF, |DE, B|r, E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, |g(t), isomer half-life.  
#  2012Ka36: {+9}Be({+238}U,F), E({+238}U)=345 MeV/nucleon beam provided  
#  by the RIBF-RIKEN accelerator facility. Fission fragments were         
#  separated and analyzed by BigRIPS separator, transported to focal      
#  plane of ZeroDegree spectrometer and finally implanted in an aluminum  
#  stopper. Particle identification was achieved by |DE-tof-B|r method.   
#  Delayed gamma rays were detected by three clover-type HPGe detectors.  
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, |g(t), isomer half-life.
