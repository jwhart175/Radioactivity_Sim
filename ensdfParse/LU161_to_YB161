#  DATA SET UPDATED (AUGUST, 2009) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE NEW QP VALUE    
#   AND ICC VAALUES FROM BRICC.                                           
#  DATA SET UPGRADED (JUNE, 2000) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE A NEW JPI VALUE  
#  FOR THE PARENT STATE AND A REVISED JPI ASSIGNMENT FOR THE 211 LEVEL,   
#  WITH APPROPRIATE CHANGES IN SOME RELATED COMMENTS.                     
#  DATA SET UPGRADED (MARCH, 1999) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE A NEW QP VALUE  
#  FOR THE PARENT GS AND MISCELLANEOUS MODIFICATIONS TO THE COMMENTS      
#  Experimental methods:                                                  
#  1979Al16:  Shorter version of 1980Be39 with 2 fewer G's and no level   
#       scheme.                                                           
#  1979AlZM:  Same data as 1979Al16.                                      
#  1980Be39:  161LU produced by spallation of W with 1-GeV proton and     
#       isotope separation.  G and x-rays measured with Ge detectors.     
#       Decay scheme is based only on G energies and intensity balances.  
#  1981RaZH:  Report; gives 161LU GS half-life.                           
#  1983Ge08:  Review of Daresbury measurements; gives same 161LU GS       
#       as in 1981RaZH.

#  The decay scheme is that of 1980Be39. Note that, with a Q+ value of    
#   5.28 MeV and no 161YB levels reported above 0.37 Mev, the proposed    
#   decay scheme is incomplete and thus no meaningful intensities can be  
#   deduced for the |e+|b{++} transitions feeding the 161YB levels.       
#G           Since the G multipolarities are unknown, a G intensity       
#G normalization is not possible. The 43-keV G can have an CC             
#G from 6.4 to 118, so there is a factor of 10 uncertainty in this        
#G transition intensity.
