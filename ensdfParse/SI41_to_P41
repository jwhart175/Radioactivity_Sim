#  Particle stability established in {+181}Ta({+48}Ca,X) (1989Gu03).      
#  2004Gr20, 2003Gr22: Fragmentation of {+48}Ca beam at 60 MeV/nucleon    
#  with Be target. The fragments were separated using LISE3 spectrometer  
#  at GANIL facility. The fragment identification by energy loss and      
#  time-of-flight measurements using Si detectors. Measured |g, ce,       
#  half-life using a Si(Li) detector and two Ge clover detectors.
