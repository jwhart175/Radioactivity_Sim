#  NEW DATA SET PREPARED (FEBRUARY, 2012) BY CW REICH.                    
#  Papers report the results of a search for the double-"beta" decay of   
#   156DY. These studies obtain only upper limits for the intensities of  
#   the branches to the various 156GD levels.                             
#  2011Be18: Search for double |b decay of 156DY, using an ultra-low      
#   background HPGe detector (volume AP 244 cm{+3}) located deep          
#   underground in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory. Detector           
#   passively shielded by a shield consisting of low-radioactivity Pb, Cu 
#   and borated polyethylene. Sample consisted of high-purity (99.98%)    
#   Dy{-2}O{-3} of mass 322 g. Sample counted for AP 2512 h. Radioactive  
#   contaminants in the sample and their associated |g's were identified. 
#   Inspection of regions of the |g-ray spectrum where 156GD |g's were    
#   expected to be present revealed no statistically significant peaks.   
#   These data provide only lower limits for the half-lives of possible   
#   2|b processes leading to 156GD.                                       
#  2011El05: Used Penning-trap mass spectrometry to determine the         
#   156DY-156GD mass difference. Together with this difference, and       
#   using theoretical electron wave functions and double-hole binding     
#   energies, authors calculate possible resonance-enhancement in the     
#   neutrinoless double electron capture in 156DY. They identify four     
#   excited states in 156GD as candidates for resonance enhancement and   
#   list computed enhancement factors.                                    
#G E         Nominal value, from the adopted values, to indicate the      
#G  region of the |g spectrum studied to identify the presence of the     
#G  searched-for 2|b transition.                                          
#L           Listed T values are measured ones only and represent lower   
#L  limits (at the 90% confidence level) for the transition from the      
#L  156DY g.s. 2011Be18 also list values for various resonant processes   
#L  in double |b decay, but these are not listed here. Numerous studies   
#L  present calculated T values for double-|b-decay, based on various     
#L  assumptions. Some of the more recent of these include: 2010Ra06;      
#L  2009Ra26; 2011Kr07; and 2002Hi09. These values are not listed here.   
#L  See these papers for them. These calculated T values are generally    
#L  several orders of magnitude greater than the presently measured       
#L  lower limits.                                                         
#L E         Nominal values, from the adopted values. Only those levels   
#L  expected to be populated in the double-|b decay of 156DY are given.
