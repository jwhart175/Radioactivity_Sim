#  From assignment of 9/2- to the 60-ns isomer at 108 keV, 1998Io01       
#  assigned 7/2+ to g.s. and increased spin by one unit all the positive- 
#  parity levels. For the negative-parity band, a new level was proposed  
#  at 119.4 keV with J|p=11/2- and energies of higher levels were adjusted
#  accordingly, and the spins increased by 2 units. The placements        
#  of 619|g, 701|g, 1028|g, 1040|g, and 1217|g were revised also. These   
#  modifications of the decay scheme proposed in 1998Io01 have not been   
#  adopted by the evaluators, since the spin of 9/2 for the 60-ns isomer  
#  at 107.6 is not considered by the evaluators as definitely determined. 
#  The experimental quadrupole interaction pattern (figure 1 in 1998Io01) 
#  fits 9/2 better than 7/2, but the fit for 9/2 still suffers from       
#  somewhat large |h{+2} of 2.7. Assignment of 9/2- for the isomer also   
#  leads to serious discrepancies with band structures and theoretical    
#  predictions                                                            
#  No meaningful |e and |b{++} feedings can be deduced since feeding      
#  to ground state of {+129}Ce is unknown and multipolarities of several  
#  low-energy transitions, with expected large conversion coefficients,   
#  are unknown. For these reasons, the decay scheme cannot be normalized  
#  to obtain |g-ray intensities per 100 {+129}Pr nuclei
