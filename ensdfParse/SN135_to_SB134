#  2005Sh23, 2005Sh53: {+135}Sn isotope produced in the UC{-2}(n,f)       
#  reaction following bombardment of a W rod with a proton-pulsed beam    
#  at E=1.4 GeV. The Sn isotopes were ionized by resonance laser          
#  ion source (RILIS) and separated using the ISOLDE general purpose mass 
#  separator (GPS). Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g coin, |g(t), |g|g(t)    
#  with five large Ge detectors.  Yields of spallation-produced Cs nuclei 
#  were lowered by several orders of magnitude when using                 
#  the neutron converter.                                                 
#  2002Sh08: Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, lifetimes, delayed neutron          
#  probability using high-efficiency Mainz neutron long counter with      
#  3-ring concentric array of 50 {+3}He proportional counters, |b         
#  detector, and Pb-shielded Ge detectors.                                
#G E$2005Sh23 quote energies to nearest keV with an uncertainty of        
#G 0.5 keV, the evaluators have added a zero in the first decimal place   
#G RI$ values quoted in 2005Sh23 are relative to I|g of 282|g in {+135}Sb.
#L E$ Deduced by evaluators from least-squares fit to E|g's.              
#L J$ All assignments changed to same as in Adopted dataset and           
#L placed in parentheses (Singh)                                          
#L J$ Assignments based on the assumption that E2 transitions are weak or 
#L nonexistent in {+134}Sb due to small collective enhancement.
