#  2010RaZY (also 2005Ma95, 2008RaZV conference reports): 71CO produced by
#  fragmentation of 86KR beam at 140 MEV/nucleon with a 9BE target at     
#  ^NSCL facility followed by A1900 fragment separator. The ions were     
#  implanted in double-sided silicon strip (^DSSD) detectors for fragment 
#  |b detection. ^Se^GA gamma-detector array containing 16 HPGe detectors 
#  was used for E|g, I|g, |g|g, |b|g coin and isotopic half-life          
#  measurements. Detailed shell-model calculations using ^NR78 residual   
#  interaction

#  2009St07: {+71}Co beam produced through {+238}U(p,X) reaction with     
#  E(p)=30 MeV at the LISOL facility. The |g rays were detected           
#  using three high-purity germanium detectors. The |b particles were     
#  detected with four plastic |DE detectors. The decay scheme for {+71}Co 
#  to {+71}Ni was taken by 2009St07 from November 2007 Sanibel Island     
#  conference report and by priv comm (references 9 and 22 in 2009St07).  
#  2005GaZR: Measured E|g, half-life. Five |g rays reported at 251, 280,  
#  568, 736 and 772 keV. No level scheme was proposed                     
#  2004Sa59: {+71}Co produced from fragmentation of {+86}Kr beam in charge
#  state 36{++}. The reaction products analyzed by LISE2000 spectrometer. 
#  Measured E|b, E|g, |b|g coin, isotopic half-life. See also 2002MaZN    
#  thesis. Four |g rays were reported at 253, 281, 566 and 774 keV;       
#  and levels were proposed at 281 (or 253), 489 (or 461), 1055           
#  (or 1027) and 1308 with J|p=(7/2+), (1/2-), (5/2-) and (5/2-),         
#  respectively, based on shell-model considerations and comparisons      
#  with {+69}Ni level scheme                                              
#  The level scheme given here is from 2010RaZY, which is primarily based 
#  on a |g|g cascade observed in coincidence and two |g rays from (5/2-)  
#  levels feeding the 1/2- isomer in analogy with the decay scheme of     
#  {+69}Co to {+69}Ni proposed in 1999Mu17. Other scenarios for the       
#  placement of 566 and 774 |g rays have been considered in 2010RaZY but  
#  ruled out on the basis of unacceptable transition rates and/or lack    
#  of |g|g coincidence correlations                                       
#  2010RaZY mention an additional experiment at NSCL (reference 40 in     
#  2010RaZY) dealing with an on-line spectroscopy for {+71}Ni in a        
#  knockout reaction on {+73}Cu beam and probably {+9}Be target, where    
#  281-, 566- and 813-keV |g rays were seen, none of these in coincidence 
#  mode. This observation confirms the placement of these |g rays in      
#  {+71}Co                                                                
#  2009St07 list five |g rays at 252, 281, 566, 774 and 813               
#  with levels at 281, (7/2+); 499, (1/2-); 813, (5/2+); 1065, (5/2-);    
#  and 1273, (5/2-) from a priv comm (reference 22 in 2009St07). The 281, 
#  566 and 774 |g rays were also seen by 2009St07, depicted in spectral   
#  figure 5 of the paper.                                                 
#  The decay scheme given here is considered as incomplete by the         
#  evaluators, thus no attempt has been made to normalize the decay scheme
#  to obtain absolute emission intensities, |b feedings and LOGFT values. 
#  However, 2010RaZY list |b feedings and  limits for three levels
