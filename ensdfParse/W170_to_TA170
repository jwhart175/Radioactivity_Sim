#G           Lines with EG=59.6, 61.3, 117.6, 144.0, thought by 1990ME12  
#G to arise from 170W EC decay, have the appropriate energy and           
#G ^T{-1/2} to be associated with 181OS EC decay, and 1997MEZZ have       
#G reassigned them to the latter decay.                                   
#G The first two are now believed to be the K|a| x ray lines of Re and the
#G other two are transitions from the first two excited states of         
#G 181RE. They may arise from beam interactions with Ta in beam-line      
#G components during source production using the 138BA(36AR,xn|g)         
#G reaction.
