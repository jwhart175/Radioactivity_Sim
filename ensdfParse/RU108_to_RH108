#  The decay scheme is based on energy fits only. 1978Fr16 suggest that   
#  the 14.6 transition deexcites a 2- level to the 1+ ground state;       
#  however, they give no arguments for the 2- assignment. It is           
#  possibly based partly on the fact that |a(14.6|g)=5.0(E1), 2617(E2) and
#  13.0(M1) so observation of the 14.6 transition in the photon           
#  spectrum suggests mult.=E1. Note that the order of the 73 and 91 |g's  
#  is not established. Even with this uncertain placement, if one         
#  assumes that the observed transitions have mult.=E1, M1 or E2,         
#  the |b{+-} feeding to the 165 level can be determined accurately       
#  enough to establish that J|p=1+. Similarly one can determine           
#  I(|b{+-} to 73.6 level)<3.4% (log| {Ift}>5.5) and I(|b{+-} to alternate
#  91.3 level)<5.0% (log| {Ift}>5.3). Feeding to the 14.6 level           
#  cannot be determined since I(14.6|g) is not known, and thus            
#  I|b(g.s.) cannot be determined. However, g.s. feeding is probably large
#  since J|p(g.s.)=1+.
