#            An independent evaluation of this decay was carried out      
#       by R. G. Helmer as part of the international Decay Data           
#       Evaluation Project.  Since the results are very similar to those  
#       given in this data set, they are included in this comment, rather 
#       than replacing the data set.  From the analysis of 5 half-life    
#       values by three different methods (1985ZiZY 1992Ra08) ,           
#       a result of 83.788 d {I22} is obtained.  The intensities          
#       of the 889- and 1120-keV |g rays are deduced to be 99.9833 {I5}   
#       and 99.986 {I+4-36}, respectivively.  The |g-ray energies can     
#       be replaced by 889.271 {I2} and 1120.537 {I3} from the            
#       2000He14 evaluation.  The details of this evaluation will be      
#       published by M.-M. Be in a report from the Laboratoire National   
#       Henri Becquerel.
