#  2000SAZO: Activity produced by 233U(6LI,4N), E=45.5 MEV.               
#  Mass-separated and                                                     
#  assigned to 235AM. Measured G rays, PU XK, Np XK, |a particles (EA).   
#  Detectors: Si-pin photodiodes for |a particles; High-purity Ge         
#  for G rays. Deduced half-life, |a/EC branching ratio.                  
#  No specific G rays were reported, and no decay scheme was constructed. 
#  All data are from 2004As12, unless otherwise stated.                   
#E TI$ Not determined explicitly in 2004As12 due                          
#E to lack of knowledge of total internal conversion coefficients of      
#E observed |g transitions.

#G RI$ Determined from both singles and coincidence |g-ray spectra.  The  
#G large uncertainties are due to low statistics and poor
