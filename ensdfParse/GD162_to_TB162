#       with radiochemistry.  G's measured with Ge and Si(Li) detectors   
#       and B's with Si(Li) detector.  GX and GB coincidences measured.   
#  1982Ge07: 162GD from 252CF spontaneous fission with radiochemistry.    
#       G's measured with Ge detector.

#B IB        From evaluator's assumption that 100% of the decays          
#B  depopulate the levels at 341 and 442 keV (that is, no B- feeding of   
#B  the ground state and the 39 level) and no G feeding of the 341-keV    
#B  level. From LOGFT GE 5.9 for the gs-to-gs B- transition (1973Ra10),   
#B  IB-(0) LE 13%; and from LOGF1T GE 8.5 for the B- transition to the 2- 
#B  at 39 keV (1973Ra10), IB-(39) LE 0.15%.                               
#G           Data are from 1982Ge07, unless otherwise noted. Others:      
#G 1970Ch02, 1967Wa05.                                                    
#L           Decay scheme is from 1982Ge07 and is similar to those of     
#L 1970Ch02 and 1967Wa05.                                                 
#L           The consistency of the scheme is supported by the fact that  
#L  the sum of the energies of the radiations is 1395 keV 56, which       
#L  agrees with the Q value of 1390 40.                                   
#L E         From least-squares fit to G energies.                        
#L J         From 162TB Adopted Levels. Rotational-band and Nilsson
