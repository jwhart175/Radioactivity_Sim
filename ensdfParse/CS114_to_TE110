#  Parent {+114}Cs nuclide was produced via {+63}Cu({+58}Ni,2p5n)         
#  reaction. E({+58}Ni)=290 MeV beam was provided by heavy-ion accelerator
#  UNILAC at GSI. A 4.2 mg/cm{+2} thick {+63}Cu target was used. Reaction 
#  products were mass-separated using online-mass separator. Two          
#  surface-barrier detector telescopes were used for particle             
#  identification. |g-rays were detected using a Ge(Li) detector. A       
#  tape-transport system was used to bring mass-separated samples from the
#  collection position of the central beam line. Measured: E|g, I|g
