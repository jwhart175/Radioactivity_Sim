#  |g rays assigned to {+239}Pa |b{+-} decay had been previously seen in

#  239PA activity was produced by bombarding a uranium target with        
#  900-MeV 18O projectiles. Protactinium was chemically separated and     
#  its genetic relation to its daughter nuclide 239U was established.     
#  The half-life of 239PA was measured by following the growth and        
#  subsequent decay of the known 74.6-keV G ray from 239U B- decay.
