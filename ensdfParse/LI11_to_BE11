#L |b-decay from polarized {+11}Be which follows the angular distribution

#L $ Assumption of neutron decays from 10600, 8820, 7030, and 3410 levels 
#L in {+11}Be and 9270 level in {+10}Be by the authors significantly      
#L improves the line shape fitting to the neutron TOF spectra.  However,  
#L the fitting failed to reproduce the spectra around |?70 and 85 ns,     
#L suggesting the existence of some unresolved peaks within those regions.
