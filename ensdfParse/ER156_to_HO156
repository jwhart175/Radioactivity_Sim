#  2002KaZL: Private communication to the evaluator from V. ^G.           
#   Kalinnikov (August, 2002). This information represents a further      
#   analysis of the data of 1999KaZV. They extend, and in some instances  
#   change, the conclusions of this earlier study.                        
#  1999KaZV: 156ER from high-energy proton-induced spallation on a ^W     
#   target. Isotope-separated samples. Measured EG, RI, CE, GG.           
#   Report EG, RI, I{_e}, multipolarities, JPI and Q(|e).                 
#  1995KaZS: Using isotope-separated 156HO sources, report T for the      
#   52-keV isomeric state.                                                
#  1982Vy06: 156ER from proton-induced spallation on a TA target.         
#   E(P)=660 MeV. Chemical and isotope separation, |g's measured using    
#   Ge(Li) detectors. CE measured using a magnetic spectrometer and       
#   spectrograph. Measured G-CE coin. Three RI values are identical to    
#   those in 1975Al26, so evaluator assumes that they were not            
#   remeasured.                                                           
#  1975Al26: 156ER from proton-induced spallation on a TA target.         
#   E(P)=660 MeV. Chemical and isotope separation  |g's measured using    
#   Ge(Li) detectors. CE measured using a magnetic spectrometer. Report   
#   EG, RI, I(CE), and deduced multipolarities.                           
#  1978Sc10: 156ER from proton-induced spallation on a TA target.         
#   E(P)=660 MeV. Isotope separation. Measured half-lives by Kx-CE coin   
#   using a NaI(Tl) detector and a magnetic spectrometer.                 
#  Others: 1981BuZJ, 1975Gr44, 1965Zh02.                                  
#  Other experiments:                                                     
#  1965Zh02: 156ER from proton-induced spallation of Ta target with       
#    E(P)=660 MeV and chemical separation. Magnetic CE spectrometers      
#    and scintillation G detectors. Deduce T(156ER) LT 12 MIN.            
#  1969Ek01: 156HO(?) from 165HO(P,PXN) at E(P)=100 MeV and DY(P,XN) at   
#    E(P)=85 MeV. Spin measured for a 55-min activity by atomic-beam      
#    magnetic resonance. The evaluator assumes that this activity was not 
#    156ER.                                                               
#  1975Gr44: Summary of work at laboratory with reference to 1975Al26.    
#  1981BuZJ: Conference abstract; report RI, I(CE), and multipolarities.  
#    Same data are reported in 1982Vy06.                                  
#  The level scheme is primarily that proposed by 2003KaZQ, together      
#   with the placement of several |g's unplaced in previous studies. It   
#   is in most instances similar to that of 1999KaZV. Where there are     
#   differences, these are pointed out. The placement of several |g's     
#   is that from the earlier studies.                                     
#  2007KaZT discuss allowed-unhindered ("spin-flip") |e transitions       
#  involving 156HO, 158HO, and 160HO and, using nuclear-model             
#  considerations, configuration assignments for several of the low-lying 
#  bandheads in these nuclides.                                           
#  From the 511-keV photon intensity, the total I|b{++}=0.21% {I10}       
#   (1982Vy06).                                                           
#  The intensities of the EC+B+ branches are computed from intensity-     
#   balance considerations and should be regarded as questionable in      
#   some instances. For example, the small LOGFT value for the            
#   transition to the 52.37, 1- level, together with the absence of       
#   a |g deexciting the 251.1 level, suggest that there are intensity     
#   imbalances in the proposed level scheme. Nonetheless, because of the  
#   strong population of the 1+ level at 117.58 kev in EC decay, the      
#   LOGFT value of the feeding transition is most probably AP 4.5,        
#   indicating an allowed-unhindered transition.
