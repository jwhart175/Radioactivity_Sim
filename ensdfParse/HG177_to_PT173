#  {+177}Hg obtained as daughter of {+181}Pb |a decay which was produced  
#  in {+144}Sm({+40}Ca,3n) at beam energy of 196 MeV at GSI SHIP facility 
#  Measured: E|a, (recoil)|a, |a|a correlations, half-lives, |a decay     
#  branching ratios.                                                      
#  Detection system: Evaporation residues were detected with position-    
#  sensitive silicon detector with |DE|?25 keV FWHM. |a- energy           
#  calibration was performed using |a-lines from {+176-182}Hg and their   
#  daughters. Distinction between the reaction and production channels    
#  was performed with three TOF detectors.                                
#  Others: 1991Se01, 1996PA01, 2002RO17.                                  
#  1975Ca39: sources from 142ND(40CA,5N) (E(40CA)=220-240 MEV),

#  1979Ha10: sources from spallation of PB by 600-MEV protons,            
#  mass separation; measured
