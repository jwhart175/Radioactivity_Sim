#H TYP=FUL$AUT=BALRAJ SINGH$CIT=ENSDF$CUT=30-APR-2010$                    
#  Includes {+235}U(n,F) and {+242}Am(n,F)                                
#  Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g|g(|q), ce, ce(|g) coin, ce(fragment) coin, 
#  |g(fragment) coin, half-lives by delayed timing method using EUROGAM2  
#  and Gammasphere arrays for prompt |g rays from {+248}Cm SF decay.      
#  Delayed |g rays following induced fission of {+235}U and {+242}Am were 
#  measured using the Lohengrin mass spectrometer at the ILL reactor in   
#  Grenoble. Comparisons with quasiparticle rotor model and deformed model
#  calculations                                                           
#  The 42.8 and 92.2 levels and associated |g rays are from delayed       
#  |g-ray study in {+235}U(n,F). The prompt 108-115-263-404-474-535-565 |g
#  cascade is from {+248}Cm SF decay                                      
#  Level scheme is established through double gating of |g rays in the    
#  cascade

#G E(D)$ From prompt |g study in {+248}Cm SF decay. Identification of     
#G |g rays in {+144}Cs is based on coincidence with known |g rays from    
#G complementary fission fragments of {+101}Nb and {+103}Nb               
#G M(X)$ |DJ=1, D+Q transition from (114.6|g)(107.9|g)(|q);
