#  1997ALZY: 151HO SOURCE PRODUCED BY 97MO(58NI,N3P)                      
#  REACTION AT 5 MEV/NUCLEON FOLLOWED BY ON-LINE MASS SEPARATION AT ^GSI  
#  FACILITY. MEASURED EG, IG, GG, GX COIN USING ^Ge DETECTORS AND CE USING
#  MINIORANGE SPECTROMETER. FULL DETAILS OF THIS STUDY ARE NOT AVAILABLE. 
#  THE AUTHORS STATE THAT RESULTS ARE PRELIMINARY                         
#  Theory: 2008Al09, calculated log {Ift} values                          
#G M$ FROM CE DATA OF 1997ALZY, BUT NO DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE              
#G E(A)$ 1990.2 LISTED IN FIGURE 2 OF 1997ALZY DOES NOT FIT BETWEEN THE   
#G LEVELS SHOWN. THE EVALUATOR CONSIDERS THIS VALUE AS MISPRINT AND       
#G ADOPTS 1999.2, INSTEAD, WHICH AGREES WELL WITH THE ENERGY DIFFERENCE   
#L E$ From least-squares fit to EG's, assuming |D(E|g)=0.5 KEV FOR EACH |G
#L E(A)$ Possible member of f{-7/2}{+3} multiplet                         
#L J$ From 1997AlZY based on their assigned multipolarities for           
#L selected transitions and probable EC feedings from (1/2+)
