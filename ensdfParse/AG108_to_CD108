#B           1962Fr07 measured |b{+-} branches of { 1650 keV} and         
#B { 1018 keV}. In addition, 1962Fr07 report the existence of a           
#B |b-branch of { 177 keV}, |?0.02%. Such a branch implies the existence  
#B of a level at |?1470. However, as has been shown by 1973Si02, such a   
#B level probably does not exist. Other |b{+-} measurements: 1960Wa10,    
#B 1956Jo23, 1953Pe16, 1952Go02.
