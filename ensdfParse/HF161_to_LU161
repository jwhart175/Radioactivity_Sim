#  DATA SET UPDATED (JULY, 2009) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE NEW QP VALUE.     
#  REVISIONS TO THE LEVEL SCHEME BY B. SINGH, FROM HEAVY-ION STUDIES,     
#  ARE ALSO INCLUDED.                                                     
#  LEVEL SCHEME ESSENTIALLY BASED ON THE LOW-LYING LEVEL STRUCTURE SHOWN  
#   BY 2006Br12 IN 139LA(28SI,6NG) AND AS LISTED IN THE ^XUNDL DATA FILE. 
#  THE G-RAY PLACEMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH COINCIDENCE DATA OF 1995Hi12. 
#  1995Hi12: 161HF produced through bombardment of BaF{-2} targets with   
#  240-MEV ^S ions. Reaction products were thermalized and swept out      
#  using He-jet gas flow and deposited in a tape-transport system. G      
#  radiation was studied with two high-resolution Ge detectors in a       
#  close geometry. ALPHA radiation was studied using a 450-mm{+2}         
#  Si surface-barrier detector placed between the G detectors. Measured   
#  excitation functions, EG,RI,EA,GG and XG coin. Mass assignment made    
#  on the basis of excitation functions.                                  
#  1989Br19: 161HF produced in the 144SM(22NE,5N) and the 147SM(20NE,6N)  
#  reactions with 163-MEV 20NE ions. Reaction products were transported   
#  using a gas-jet transport system and absorbed in a solution, where     
#  chemical separation was performed. G radiation was studied using a     
#  2.1-cm{+3} HPGe detector and a 35-cm{+3} GELI detector. The authors    
#  report T and 2 G's, having EG=135.6 and 180.0. 1995Hi12, however,      
#  assign this latter G to the 165HF decay.                               
#  The data are from 1995Hi12. The level scheme is based on low-lying     
#  level structure established by 2006Br12 in 139LA(28SI,6NG) STUDY,      
#  where several |g-ray energies are found to be similar to those         
#  in 1995Hi12                                                            
#G           AN 180 G, previously assigned to the 161HF decay, has been   
#G assigned instead by 1995Hi12 to the 165HF decay.
