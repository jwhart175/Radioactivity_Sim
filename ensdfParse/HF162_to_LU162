#  DATA SET UPDATED (MARCH, 2006) BY CW REICH TO INCLUDE NEW Q+ VALUE,

#  1995Hi12: source material produced via the 135BA(32S,5N) reaction, with
#  E(32S) having five different values, ranging from 214 MEV down to      
#  172 MEV. Enriched (92.7% 135BA) BaF{-2} targets. The reaction products 
#  were removed from the reaction chamber to a moving tape, for           
#  subsequent analysis, using a He-jet system. Measurements were made     
#  with two high-resolution Ge detectors in a close 180 DEG geometry      
#  and a 450-mm{+2} Si surface |a detector. Excitation functions were     
#  used to assign mass numbers to the radiations. Measured EG, RI, GG,    
#  XG, T1/2, EA.                                                          
#  1982Sc15: source material produced via the 142ND(24MG,4N) reaction on  
#  an enriched (96.24% 142ND) target. G singles and GG coincidences       
#  measured with Ge detectors.                                            
#  ALPHA's measured with Si detector.                                     
#  The data are from 1995Hi12, unless noted otherwise

#  1981LiZM:  Produced by YB(3HE,XN) reaction and isotope separation.  G  
#       measured with Ge detectors.  Report T1/2.                         
#  1982Br31:  Produced by 147SM(20NE,5N) reaction.  G measured with Ge    
#       detector.  Report T1/2 and two G's.                               
#  1982Sc15:  Produced by 142ND(24MG,4N) reaction on enriched (96.24%)    
#       target.  G singles and GG coincidences measured with Ge detectors.
#       ALPHA's measured with Si detector.                                
#G           The data are from 1995Hi12, unless noted otherwise           
#G           Values of CC for several multipolarities are given in the    
#G ENSDF file.                                                            
#G RI        annihilation radiation is observed, but 511 peak includes    
#G contribution from 163HF decay. For the combined 511 peak,              
#G RI(174)/I(511)=1.13 21 (1982Sc15).                                     
#G E(M)      From 1982Sc15. This value agrees well with that of 1995Hi12, 
#G but is considerably more precise.                                      
#G E(P)      The ordering of these two transitions is that given by both  
#G 1982Sc15 and 1995Hi12, but it has not been definitely established      
#G E(R)      The ordering of these two transitions is not definitely      
#G established. The one shown here is that shown by 1995Hi12, based on the
#G larger intensity of the 79G.                                           
#L E(N)      Level not reported by 1982Sc15
