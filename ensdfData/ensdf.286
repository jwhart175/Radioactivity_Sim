286  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
286  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
286  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
286  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
286  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
286  6c  any element.                                                           
286  !c                                                                         
286  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
286  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
286  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
286  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
286  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
286  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
286  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
286  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
286  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
286  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
286  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
286  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
286  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
286  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
286  #c                                                                         
286  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
286  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
286  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
286  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
286  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
286  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
286  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
286  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
286  #c                                                                         
286  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
286  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
286  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
286  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
286  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

286  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
286  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
286  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
286  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
286  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

286  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
286  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
286  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
286  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
286  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
286  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
286  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
286  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
286  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
286  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
286  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
286  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

286  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
286  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
286  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
286  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
286  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
286  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
286  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
286  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
286  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
286  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
286  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
286  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
286  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
286  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
286  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
286  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
286  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
286  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
286  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
286  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
286  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
286  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
286  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
286  Oc  face competition from fission.

286  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
286  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
286  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
286  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
286  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
286  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
286  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
286  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
286  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
286  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

286  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
286  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
286  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
286  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
286  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
286  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
286  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

286  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
286  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
286  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

286  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

286  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

286  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
286  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
286  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
286  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
286  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
286  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
286  #c                                                                         
286  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
286  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
286  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
286  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
286  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
286  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
286  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
286  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
286  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
286  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
286  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
286  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
286  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
286  #c                                                                         
286  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
286  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
286  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
286  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
286  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
286  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
286  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
286  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
286  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
286  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
286  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

286  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
286  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
286  3c  of the various arguments put

286  #c                                                                         
286  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
286  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
286  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
286  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
286  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
286  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
286  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
286  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
286  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
286  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
286  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
286  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
286  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
286  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
286  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

286  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
286  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
286  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
286  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
286  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
286  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
286  #c                                                                         
286  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
286  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
286  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
286  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
286  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
286  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
286  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
286  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
286  !c                                                                         
286  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
286  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

286  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
286  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
286  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
286  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
286  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
286  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

286CN C  2004OG10: THE REINTERPRETATION OF ONE LONG LIVED DECAY CHAIN FIRST     
286CN2C  OBSERVED IN 1999OG10 AT DUBNA, AND TENTATIVELY ASSIGNED TO THE DECAY OF
286CN3C  28914, IS NOW PROPOSED AS POSSIBLY ORIGINATING FROM THE ^CN 29014      
286CN4C  {IVIA} THE 2{IN} CHANNEL. THE SUBSEQUENT ALPHA-DECAYS WOULD THEN BE:   
286CN5C  {+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF). THE

286CN6C  PICOBARN IN THE REACTION 244PU+48CA AT 236 MEV (^E*=35 MEV). THIS EVENT
286CN7C  WAS NOT OBSERVED IN LATER EXPERIMENTS DONE AT ENERGIES OF ^E*=41-53 MEV
286CN8C  (2000OG05,2000OG07). THE ALPHA PARTICLE ENERGY OF THE FIRST DECAY IS   
286CN9C  AP 0.1 MEV LESS THAN THAT ATTRIBUTED TO 28914 FROM LATER WORK. AN      
286CNAC  ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION BASED ON CALCULATIONS (1999CW01) IS THAT    
286CNBC  THIS CHAIN MAY BELONG TO A RARE  DECAY BRANCH OF 28914 STARTING FROM   
286CNCC  AN EXCITED STATE AND GOING TO LOW LYING LEVELS IN THE DAUGHTER GOVERNED

286149C  CREATED WITH 244PU AND 248CM TARGETS. THE BEAM OF 48CA IONS WAS        
28614AC  PROVIDED BY THE ^JINR ^U400 CYCLOTRON AND ^EVR's WERE SEPARATED BY     
28614BC  ^DGFRS. A FISSION FRAGMENT CALIBRATION WAS PERFORMED USING SF          
28614CC  FRAGMENTS FROM 252NO WITH A KNOWN AVERAGE ENERGY RELEASE OF ABOUT 176  
28614DC  MEV. 18 SF EVENTS OBSERVED SEPARABLE INTO TWO GROUPS BY ENERGY:        
28614EC  16 EVENTS WITH AN AVERAGE TOTAL E=158 MEV (125 LE E(TOT) LE 175 MEV)   
28614FC  AND TWO EVENTS WITH E(TOT)=207 MEV AND 223 MEV. CORRESPONDING LOWER

28614 C  THE OTHER TWO FISSION EVENTS WERE PRECEDED BY RECOIL SIGNALS ASCRIBED  
286142C  TO ALPHA DECAY FROM A HIGHER ^A-PARENT. IN PARTICULAR, THE EVENT WITH  
286143C  E(TOT)=207 MEV POINTS TO A STRONG CORRELATION OF ALPHA DECAYS IN AN    
286144C  ^EVR-|a1-|a2-SF SEQUENCE WITH A PROBABILITY OF RANDOMNESS ESTIMATED TO 
286145C  BE LT 1.5E-06. THE INSTANTANEOUS BEAM ENERGY WAS 245.6 MEV             
286146C  CORRESPONDING TO AN EXCITATION ENERGY OF 29.8 MEV 20 IN THE            
286147C  COMPOUND SYSTEM 29718 (SEE 29418 ADOPTED LEVELS FOR DETAILS).          
286148C  E{-|a1}=11.65 MEV 6, t{-1}=2.55 MS; E{-|a2}=10.71 MEV 17, t{-2}=42.1   
286149C  MS, E{-TOT}SF=207 MEV, t(SF)=0.52 S. THE SEQUENCE ENDED WITH THE SF OF 
28614AC  28614.                                                                 
28614 C  FOR THE SECOND EVENT WITH E(TOT)=223 MEV NO ALPHA-LIKE SIGNALS WERE    
286142C  DETECTED DURING THE ^EVR-SF EVENT. TWO COINCIDENT FRAGMENTS SEEN WITH  
286143C  WITH ENERGIES OF 137 MEV (FOCAL PLANE DETECTOR) AND 86 MEV             
286144C  (SIDE DETECTOR). THE INSTANTANEOUS BEAM ENERGY WAS 246.1 MEV           
286145C  CORRESPONDING TO A COMPOUND NUCLEUS EXCITATION ENERGY OF               
286146C  30.2 MEV 23.  A COMPARISON OF THE  EXCITATION FUNCTIONS AND DECAY

286148C  REACTION WITH THE ^EVR-SF EVENTS IN THE 238U REACTION SUGGEST THAT THEY
286149C  ORIGINATE FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ISOTOPES 28614 AND 28212, RESPECTIVELY.
28614AC  OF THE 13 DECAYS OBSERVED IN TOTAL FOR 28614, ONLY FIVE ALPHA-DECAYS   
28614CC  WERE OBSERVED: b(ALPHA) AP 0.4.

28614 C  28614 IS ALSO THE ALPHA DECAY GRANDDAUGHTER OF 29418 BUT WITH          
286142C  DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.  ASSIGNMENTS FOR DAUGHTERS ARE ALSO              
286143C  TENTATIVE AND BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PARENT NUCLEUS IS       
286144C  29418 {IVIA} THE 3{In} CHANNEL FROM THE ^CN 29718. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT
286145C  THE SUBSEQUENT ALPHA-DECAYS ARE GENETICALLY LINKED WITH A PROBABILITY  
286146C  P>87%. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE APPLICATION OF THE Viola-Seaborg       
286147C  RELATIONSHIP AS APPLIED TO EVEN-EVEN ISOTOPES TO CALCULATE Z FOR       
286148C  THE NUCLIDES THAT UNDERGO ALPHA-DECAY PRIOR TO SF.                     
28614 C  2004OG07 AT DUBNA IN THE REACTION 245CM(48CA,3N) AT A BEAM ENERGY OF   
286142C  243 MEV. THIS MEASUREMENT, USING THE Ca BEAM INITIATED A NEW SERIES    
286143C  OF EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN THE SYNTHESIS OF NEW Z=116       
286144C  ISOTOPES. THIS NUCLEUS (28614) IS ALSO PRODUCED AS THE ALPHA-DECAY     
286145C  DAUGHTER OF 29016. THE 48CA BEAM WAS ACCELERATED BY THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON
286146C  AT THE ^FLNR/^JINR. THE TYPICAL BEAM INTENSITY WAS 1.2 p|mA. THE TARGET
286147C  WAS ENRICHED TO 98.7%. THE ^EVR's RECOILING FROM THE TARGET WERE       
286148C  SEPARATED BY THE ^DGFRS WITH A TRANSMISSION EFFICIENCY OF              
286149C  35-40% FOR Z=114 AND 116 NUCLEI. ^EVR RECOILS PASSED THROUGH A TOF     
28614AC  SYSTEM AND WERE IMPLANTED IN A SEMICONDUCTOR ARRAY. THE POSITION       
28614BC  AVERAGED DETECTION EFFICIENCY FOR ALPHA-DECAYS OF IMPLANTED NUCLEI WAS 
28614CC  87% OF 4PI WITH AN ENERGY RESOLUTION OF 60-90 KEV FOR ALPHA'S ABSORBED 
28614DC  IN THE FOCAL PLANE DETECTOR. THOSE THAT ESCAPED REGISTERED A SUMMED    
28614EC  SIGNAL WITH A RESOLUTION OF 140-200 KEV IN THE SIDE DETECTOR. ALL THE  
28614FC  CORRELATED EVENTS OBSERVED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS HAD POSITION DEVIATIONS
28614GC  CORRESPONDING TO THE GIVEN POSITION RESOLUTIONS: 0.8-1.3 MM FOR        
28614HC  ^EVR-ALPHA SIGNALS AND 0.5-0.8 MM FOR ^EVR-SF SIGNALS. THREE DECAY     
28614IC  SEQUENCES WERE RECORDED AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO PARENT 29016. THIS NUCLEUS 
28614JC  WAS OBSERVED AS THE ALPHA-DECAY DAUGHTER OF 29016. OF THE THREE EVENTS 
28614KC  28614 UNDERGOES SF IN TWO CASES AND ALPHA-DECAY IN ONE CASE:           
28614LC  EA=10.03 MEV (ESCAPED ALPHA, RECORDED IN SIDE DETECTOR ONLY), T=1.448  
28614MC  MS. THE ALPHA-DECAY OF THIS ISOTOPE WAS NOT OBSERVED IN THE DECAY CHAIN
28614NC  ORIGINATING FROM 29418 (SEE 2002OGZX,2003OGZZ). THE POSSIBILITY THAT   
28614OC  THIS NUCLEUS UNDERGOES ALPHA-DECAY ALONG WITH SF CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS
28614PC  IT IS SEEN THAT T(ALPHA) IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO T(SF). THE          
28614QC  ALPHA-DECAY PROPERTIES ARE CONSIDERED TENTATIVE BY THE EVALUATORS UNTIL
28614RC  BETTER STATISTICS ARE ACHIEVED. THE TWO SF EVENTS HAD A TOTAL          
28614SC  E(SF)=193 MEV AND 176 MEV,  WHERE ONLY THE FIRST EVENT WAS RECORDED    
28614TC  IN BOTH THE FOCAL PLANE AND THE SIDE DETECTORS WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR   
28614UC  THE DIFFERENCE IN ENERGIES BETWEEN THE TWO MEASUREMENTS. (SEE 2004OG05 
28614VC  FOR MORE DETAILS AND DISCUSSION).

286142C  REACTION AT DUBNA USING ^DGFRS. A TOTAL OF 9 ^EVR-|a/SF-SF CHAINS      
286143C  MEASURED: 7 AT 244 MEV AND 2 AT 250 MEV. THE SECOND |a/SF EVENT WAS    
286144C  ATTRIBUTED TO 28614 WHICH FISSIONED IN 5 OF THE SEQUENCES.             
286145C  2004OG12, 2004OGZZ DISCUSS ALL ASSIGNMENTS IN DETAIL. THE TWO PAPERS   
286146C  ARE IDENTICAL IN MANY RESPECTS. 2004OGZZ REPORT MORE STATISTICS IN
