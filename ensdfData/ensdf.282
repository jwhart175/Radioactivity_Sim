282  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
282  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
282  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
282  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
282  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
282  6c  any element.                                                           
282  !c                                                                         
282  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
282  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
282  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
282  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
282  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
282  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
282  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
282  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
282  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
282  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
282  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
282  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
282  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
282  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
282  #c                                                                         
282  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
282  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
282  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
282  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
282  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
282  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
282  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
282  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
282  #c                                                                         
282  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
282  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
282  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
282  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
282  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

282  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
282  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
282  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
282  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
282  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

282  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
282  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
282  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
282  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
282  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
282  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
282  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
282  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
282  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
282  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
282  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
282  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

282  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
282  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
282  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
282  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
282  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
282  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
282  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
282  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
282  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
282  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
282  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
282  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
282  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
282  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
282  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
282  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
282  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
282  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
282  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
282  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
282  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
282  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
282  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
282  Oc  face competition from fission.

282  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
282  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
282  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
282  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
282  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
282  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
282  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
282  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
282  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
282  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

282  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
282  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
282  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
282  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
282  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
282  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
282  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

282  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
282  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
282  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

282  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

282  Bc  2004OgZZ (15 data points, using DGFRS), although the E|a is in

282  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

282  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
282  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
282  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
282  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
282  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
282  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
282  #c                                                                         
282  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
282  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
282  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
282  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
282  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
282  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
282  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
282  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
282  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
282  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
282  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
282  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
282  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
282  #c                                                                         
282  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
282  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
282  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
282  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
282  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
282  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
282  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
282  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
282  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
282  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
282  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

282  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
282  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
282  3c  of the various arguments put

282  #c                                                                         
282  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
282  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
282  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
282  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
282  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
282  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
282  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
282  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
282  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
282  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
282  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
282  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
282  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
282  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
282  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

282  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
282  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
282  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
282  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
282  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
282  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
282  #c                                                                         
282  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
282  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
282  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
282  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
282  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
282  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
282  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
282  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
282  !c                                                                         
282  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
282  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

282  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
282  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
282  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
282  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
282  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
282  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

282DS C  2004OG10: THE REINTERPRETATION OF ONE LONG LIVED DECAY CHAIN FIRST     
282DS2C  REPORTED IN 1999OG10 AT DUBNA, AND TENTATIVELY SUGGESTED AS A          
282DS3C  {ICANDIDATE} FOR THE DECAY OF 28914, HAS SINCE BEEN PROPOSED AS        
282DS4C  POSSIBLY ORIGINATING FROM THE ^CN 29014                                
282DS4C  {IVIA} THE 2{IN} CHANNEL. THE SUBSEQUENT ALPHA-DECAYS WOULD THEN BE:   
282DS5C  {+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF). THE

282DS6C  PICOBARN IN THE REACTION 244PU+48CA AT 236 MEV (^E*=35 MEV). THIS EVENT
282DS7C  WAS NOT OBSERVED IN LATER EXPERIMENTS DONE AT ENERGIES OF ^E*=41-53 MEV
282DS8C  (2000OG05,2000OG07). THE ALPHA PARTICLE ENERGY OF THE FIRST DECAY IS   
282DS9C  AP 0.1 MEV LESS THAN THAT ATTRIBUTED TO 28914 FROM LATER WORK. AN      
282DSAC  ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION BASED ON CALCULATIONS (1999CW01) IS THAT    
282DSBC  THIS CHAIN MAY BELONG TO A RARE  DECAY BRANCH OF 28914 STARTING FROM   
282DSCC  AN EXCITED STATE AND GOING TO LOW LYING LEVELS IN THE DAUGHTER GOVERNED

282132C  ^EVR-ALPHA PAIR FOLLOWED BY THREE MORE ALPHA DECAYS TERMINATED BY AN   
282133C  SF EVENT UNDER BEAM OFF CONDITIONS WAS LESS THAN 1E-12. ESTIMATE OF    
282134C  RANDOMNESS IN THE CASE OF THE SECOND CHAIN WAS 3E-6 SINCE THE          
282135C  CONDITIONS FOR BEAM-OFF WERE NOT MET. THE ASSIGNMENT TO 270BH IN THE   
282136C  SECOND CHAIN IS TENTATIVE SINCE THE MEASUREMENT OCCURRED WITH THE BEAM 
282137C  ON. THE PROBABILITY THAT A RANDOM EVENT COULD OCCUR WITHIN THE
