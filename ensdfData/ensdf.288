288  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
288  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
288  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
288  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
288  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
288  6c  any element.                                                           
288  !c                                                                         
288  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
288  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
288  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
288  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
288  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
288  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
288  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
288  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
288  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
288  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
288  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
288  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
288  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
288  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
288  #c                                                                         
288  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
288  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
288  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
288  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
288  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
288  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
288  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
288  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
288  #c                                                                         
288  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
288  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
288  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
288  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
288  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

288  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
288  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
288  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
288  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
288  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

288  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
288  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
288  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
288  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
288  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
288  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
288  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
288  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
288  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
288  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
288  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
288  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

288  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
288  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
288  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
288  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
288  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
288  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
288  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
288  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
288  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
288  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
288  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
288  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
288  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
288  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
288  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
288  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
288  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
288  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
288  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
288  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
288  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
288  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
288  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
288  Oc  face competition from fission.

288  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
288  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
288  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
288  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
288  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
288  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
288  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
288  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
288  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
288  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

288  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
288  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
288  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
288  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
288  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
288  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
288  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

288  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
288  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
288  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

288  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

288  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

288  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
288  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
288  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
288  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
288  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
288  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
288  #c                                                                         
288  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
288  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
288  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
288  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
288  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
288  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
288  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
288  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
288  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
288  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
288  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
288  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
288  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
288  #c                                                                         
288  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
288  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
288  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
288  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
288  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
288  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
288  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
288  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
288  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
288  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
288  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

288  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
288  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
288  3c  of the various arguments put

288  #c                                                                         
288  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
288  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
288  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
288  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
288  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
288  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
288  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
288  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
288  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
288  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
288  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
288  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
288  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
288  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
288  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

288  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
288  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
288  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
288  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
288  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
288  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
288  #c                                                                         
288  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
288  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
288  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
288  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
288  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
288  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
288  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
288  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
288  !c                                                                         
288  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
288  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

288  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
288  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
288  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
288  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
288  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
288  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

288152C  MEV (2003OGZY,2004OG03) AND E=243 MEV, CHEM (2004DMZZ). THE EVALUATORS 
288153C  SUGGEST THAT 2004DMZZ OFFERS INDEPENDENT SUPPORT TO THE SYNTHESIS OF   
288154C  28815 (2004OG03) HAVING PRECISELY DETERMINED THE ATOMIC NUMBER FOR     
288155C  Z=105 BY ISOLATION OF Group ^V ELEMENTS. THE PROPERTIES ARE IN         
288156C  AGREEMENT WITH 268DB MEASURED IN THE THREE CHAINS SEEN EARLIER BY      
288157C  2004OG03, THEREBY PROVIDING EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE SYNTHESIS OF      
288158C  28815 AND DAUGHTERS. HOWEVER, SINCE THE IDENTIFICATION RELIES          
288159C  ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SF FRAGMENTS, THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OBSERVED  
28815aC  NUCLEUS IS ACTUALLY 268RF FOLLOWING (UNDETECTED) EC FROM THE PARENT    
28815aC  268DB, CANNOT BE EXCLUDED.
