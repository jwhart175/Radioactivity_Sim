256LR5cL considered; therefore, this branching should be an upper limit.        
256LR6cL In authors' other paper, 1968Fl01, the authors stated that it was      
256LR7cL impossible to determine the branching from their data. The authors

256RFBc  A total of 783 {+256}Rf nuclei were identified from SF decay

256DB2cL {+209}Bi({+49}Ti,2n) reaction and also in {+260}Bh |a decay. This work 
256DB3cL has not been published, and the results given have not been confirmed  
256DB4cL by others.

256DB cL %SF       only SF decay has been observed. |a and |b{++} decay modes   
256DB2cL are also expected. Theoretical partial half-lives of { 15.1 s} and     
256DB3cL { 22.9 s} for |a and |b decays calculated by 1997Mo25, for example,    
256DB4cL predict %|a=17.2 and %|b{++}=11.4 which suggest %SF=71.4. Theoretical  
256DB5cL calculations by 1985Lo17, on the other hand, predict                   
256DB6cL log T{-1/2}(SF)|?-9.5 in years, or T{-1/2}(SF)|?{ 0.01 s}, suggesting  
256DB7cL %SF|?100.
