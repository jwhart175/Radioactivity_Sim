278  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
278  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
278  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
278  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
278  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
278  6c  any element.                                                           
278  !c                                                                         
278  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
278  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
278  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
278  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
278  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
278  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
278  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
278  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
278  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
278  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
278  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
278  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
278  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
278  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
278  #c                                                                         
278  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
278  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
278  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
278  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
278  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
278  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
278  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
278  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
278  #c                                                                         
278  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
278  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
278  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
278  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
278  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

278  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
278  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
278  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
278  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
278  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

278  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
278  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
278  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
278  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
278  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
278  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
278  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
278  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
278  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
278  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
278  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
278  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

278  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
278  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
278  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
278  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
278  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
278  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
278  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
278  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
278  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
278  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
278  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
278  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
278  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
278  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
278  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
278  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
278  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
278  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
278  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
278  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
278  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
278  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
278  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
278  Oc  face competition from fission.

278  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
278  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
278  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
278  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
278  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
278  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
278  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
278  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
278  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
278  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

278  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
278  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
278  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
278  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
278  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
278  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
278  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

278  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
278  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
278  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

278  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

278  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

278  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
278  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
278  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
278  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
278  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
278  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
278  #c                                                                         
278  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
278  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
278  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
278  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
278  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
278  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
278  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
278  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
278  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
278  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
278  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
278  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
278  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
278  #c                                                                         
278  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
278  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
278  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
278  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
278  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
278  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
278  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
278  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
278  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
278  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
278  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

278  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
278  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
278  3c  of the various arguments put

278  #c                                                                         
278  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
278  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
278  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
278  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
278  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
278  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
278  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
278  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
278  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
278  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
278  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
278  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
278  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
278  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
278  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

278  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
278  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
278  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
278  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
278  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
278  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
278  #c                                                                         
278  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
278  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
278  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
278  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
278  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
278  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
278  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
278  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
278  !c                                                                         
278  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
278  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

278  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
278  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
278  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
278  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
278  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
278  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

278HS C  2004OG10: THE REINTERPRETATION OF ONE LONG LIVED DECAY CHAIN FIRST     
278HS2C  OBSERVED IN 1999OG10 AT DUBNA, AND TENTATIVELY ASSIGNED TO THE DECAY OF
278HS3C  28914, IS NOW PROPOSED AS POSSIBLY ORIGINATING FROM THE ^CN 29014      
278HS4C  {IVIA} THE 2{IN} CHANNEL. THE SUBSEQUENT ALPHA-DECAYS WOULD THEN BE:   
278HS5C  {+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF). THE CROSS-SECTION

278HS6C  PICOBARN IN THE REACTION 244PU+48CA AT 236 MEV (^E*=35 MEV). THIS EVENT
278HS7C  WAS NOT OBSERVED IN LATER EXPERIMENTS DONE AT ENERGIES OF ^E*=41-53 MEV
278HS8C  (2000OG05,2000OG07). THE ALPHA PARTICLE ENERGY OF THE FIRST DECAY IS   
278HS9C  AP 0.1 MEV LESS THAN THAT ATTRIBUTED TO 28914 FROM LATER WORK. AN      
278HSAC  ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION BASED ON CALCULATIONS (1999CW01) IS THAT    
278HSBC  THIS CHAIN MAY BELONG TO A RARE  DECAY BRANCH OF 28914 STARTING FROM   
278HSCC  AN EXCITED STATE AND GOING TO LOW LYING LEVELS IN THE DAUGHTER GOVERNED
278HSDC  BY THE APPROPRIATE SELECTION RULES. 3 MINUTE ALPHA-SF EVENT OBSERVED IN

278HS C  ASSIGNMENT: ^IUPAP/^IUPAC ^JWP ASSESSMENT (2003KA71): DISCOVERY OF

278HS5C  THE ASSIGNMENT OF THIS DECAY CHAIN TO EITHER 29014 OR 28914 AND,

278139C  AVERAGE EXCITATION ENERGY WAS 10.54 AMeV FOR AN EFFECTIVE CROSS-       
27813AC  SECTION OF 0.6 pb (ARRIVED AT BY COMBINING THE TWO MEASURED            
27813BC  CROSS-SECTIONS). NO EVENTS WERE OBSERVED IN EITHER RUN.                
27813 C  2004MO42: COLD FUSION EXPERIMENT DONE AT ^RIKEN IN COLLABORATION       
278132C  WITH Chinese SCIENTISTS IN 2003/2004. REACTION: 209BI(70ZN,N) AT A     
278133C  BEAM ENERGY OF 352.6 MEV PROVIDED BY ^RILAC CORRESPONDING TO AN ENERGY 
278134C  AT TARGET CENTER OF 349 MEV. THE ABSOLUTE ACCURACY OF THE BEAM ENERGY  
278135C  WAS |+0.6 MEV. THE PRODUCTION CROSS-SECTION WAS 55 fb {I+150-45}.      
278136C  SIXTEEN TARGETS WERE MOUNTED ON A ROTATING WHEEL (2000 RPM) WITH A     
278137C  DIAMETER OF 30 CM. PRODUCTS FOLLOWING THE REACTION WERE SEPARATED      
278138C  IN-FLIGHT BY ^GARIS (2004MO40) FILLED WITH He GAS, AND GUIDED INTO     
278139C  A FOCAL PLANE DETECTOR CONSISTING OF A TIMING MODULE WITH              
27813AC  MICROCHANNEL PLATES (^MCP) AND A ^SSD (Si SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR) BOX  
27813BC  WHICH INCLUDED ONE DETECTOR WITH 16 POSITION SENSITIVE STRIPS (^PSD).  
27813CC  ^EVR's WERE IMPLANTED IN THE ^PSD AFTER THEY PASS THROUGH THE TIMING   
27813DC  COUNTERS. A TOTAL OF 1.7E+19 IONS IMPINGED ON THE TARGET; TRANSMISSION 
27813EC  EFFICIENCY OF ^GARIS WAS 0.8 (2004MO26). THE EXCITATION ENERGY OF THE  
27813FC  27913 ^CN WAS CALCULATED TO BE 14.1 MEV 20.                            
27813aC  A SINGLE ^EVR-|a1-|a2-|a3-|a4-SF SEQUENCE WAS OBSERVED ON 23 JULY 2004:
27813 t    {TV}Event #1: Energy of the evaporation residue=36.75 MeV            
278132t       E{-|a1}=11.68 MeV {I4}   t{-1}=344 |ms    -   assigned to         
27813+t   {+278}113                                                             
278133t       E{-|a2}=11.15 MeV {I7}   t{-2}=9.26 ms   -   assigned to {+274}Rg 
278134t       E{-|a3}=10.03 MeV {I7}   t{-3}=7.16 ms   -   assigned to {+270}Mt 
278135t       E{-|a4}= 9.08 MeV {I4}   t{-4}=2.47 s    -   assigned to {+266}Bh 
278136t       E(SF)=204.1 MeV   t(SF)=40.9 s -   assigned to {+262}Db           
27813 D  THIS IS THE FIRST FEMTO-BARN CROSS-SECTION ENCOUNTERED SO FAR AND WELL 
27813aD  BELOW THE LIMIT PREDICTED BY ^GSI.                                     
27813aD  THE SMALLNESS MAY BE DUE TO THE COLD-FUSION LIMIT BEING REACHED:       
27813aD  ALREADY ABOUT 1 pb IN THE GSI EXPERIMENT FOR 27712.                    
27813aD  HIGHER CROSS-SECTIONS COULD BE EXPECTED BY HOT-FUSION, BUT THE         
27813aD  NECESSARY BEAM-TARGET COMBINATIONS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. HENCE, THIS   
27813aD  IS ALSO THE FIRST INSTANCE OF A DIRECT MEASUREMENT FOR Z=113. ONLY     
27813aD  OTHER INSTANCE IS IN THE CASE OF 28313 (1 ATOM) AND 28413              
27813aD  (3 ATOMS) AS DAUGHTERS OF Z=115 AS REPORTED IN 2003OGZY AND 2004OG03.

278132C  REACTION. ALSO, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE PARENT AS 27813, ALPHA-DECAY 
278133C  DAUGHTER 274RG, AND GRAND-DAUGHTER 270MT, ARE ALL RENDERED PLAUSIBLE   
278134C  FOLLOWING A CONSISTENT COMPARISON OF THE 4{+th} AND 5{+th} EVENTS WITH 
278135C  KNOWN DESCENDENTS. THE OBSERVATION OF EACH ISOTOPE IN THE SEQUENCE     
278136C  SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS TENTATIVE AND PENDING CONFIRMATION.
