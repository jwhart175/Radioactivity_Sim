280  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
280  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
280  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
280  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
280  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
280  6c  any element.                                                           
280  !c                                                                         
280  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
280  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
280  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
280  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
280  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
280  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
280  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
280  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
280  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
280  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
280  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
280  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
280  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
280  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
280  #c                                                                         
280  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
280  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
280  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
280  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
280  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
280  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
280  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
280  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
280  #c                                                                         
280  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
280  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
280  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
280  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
280  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

280  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
280  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
280  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
280  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
280  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

280  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
280  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
280  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
280  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
280  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
280  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
280  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
280  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
280  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
280  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
280  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).

280  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
280  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
280  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
280  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
280  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
280  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
280  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
280  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
280  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
280  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
280  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
280  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
280  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
280  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
280  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
280  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
280  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
280  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
280  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
280  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
280  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
280  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
280  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
280  Oc  face competition from fission.

280  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
280  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
280  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
280  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
280  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
280  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
280  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
280  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
280  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
280  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

280  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
280  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
280  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
280  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
280  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
280  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
280  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

280  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
280  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
280  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

280  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

280  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
280  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
280  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
280  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
280  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
280  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
280  #c                                                                         
280  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
280  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
280  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
280  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
280  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
280  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
280  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
280  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
280  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
280  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
280  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
280  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
280  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
280  #c                                                                         
280  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
280  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
280  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
280  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
280  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
280  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
280  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
280  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
280  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
280  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed

280  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
280  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
280  3c  of the various arguments put

280  #c                                                                         
280  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
280  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
280  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
280  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
280  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
280  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
280  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
280  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
280  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
280  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
280  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
280  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
280  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
280  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
280  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

280  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
280  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
280  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
280  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
280  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
280  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
280  #c                                                                         
280  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
280  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
280  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
280  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
280  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
280  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
280  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
280  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
280  !c                                                                         
280  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
280  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

280  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
280  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
280  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
280  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
280  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
280  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the
