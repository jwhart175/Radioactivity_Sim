217TL2c  with a beam energy of 1 GeV/nucleon produced by the SIS synchrotron    
217TL3c  at GSI facility. Target=2500 mg/cm{+2}. The fragment residues were     
217TL4c  analyzed with the high resolving power magnetic spectrometer Fragment

217PO CL           In analogy to the isotone {+219}Rn, 1997Li23 suggested that  
217PO2CL {+217}Po g.s. has JPI=11/2+, and interpreted as arising from a mixed   
217PO3CL 1/2+ and 3/2+ reflection asymmetric orbital which is closely related   
217PO4CL to the i{-11/2} shell state. The nucleus has two protons and seven     
217PO5CL neutrons above the Z=82 and N=126 closed shells, respectively, and     
217PO6CL small quadrupole deformation for 217PO is expected. See 1997Li23 for   
217PO7CL discussions.

217PO CL           1997Li23 suggested JPI=7/2+ for this level in analogy to     
217PO2CL {+219}Rn. The 254.2-keV (E2) transition from this level is consistent  
217PO3CL with the proposed JPI, if the ground state is 11/2+.

217FR2C  negative parities were calculated by 1995De13 for a soft potential     
217FR3C  with quadrupole and octupole equilibrium deformations; results were    
217FR4C  compared with experiments.                                             
217FR C  The experimental and theoretical evidence for intrinsic                
217FR2C  reflection-asymmetric shapes were reviewed; the theoretical methods    
217FR3C  were discussed by 1996Bu45. See 1987Sh24 for a study of static         
217FR4C  quadrupole-octupole deformation in the region.

217FR C  Gamma excitation function, angular distribution and |g|g               
217FR2C  coincidences were measured. Assignments of gammas to {+217}Fr were     
217FR3C  based on coincidences with the francium X-RAYS and on the excitation   
217FR4C  functions, as well as on comparison of the spectra taken with          
217FR5C  different folds, that is with fold GE 1 and with fold GE 2 (1988Ai02). 
217FR C  From the similarity of alternating parity bands in {+217}Fr and        
217FR2C  {+218}Fr and from deduced large B(E1)/B(E2) ratios for transitions     
217FR3C  deexciting several states in {+217}Fr, 1988Ai02 proposed that {+217}Fr 
217FR4C  has octupole deformation. From a comparison of these two opposite      
217FR5C  parity bands with those in {+218}Ra, 1988Ai02 suggests that {+217}Fr   
217FR6C  is a "borderline" nucleus where the onset of static intrinsic          
217FR7C  reflection asymmetric shape takes place.

217FR3CG Since no delay component was observed in |g|g(t), M2 multipolarities   
217FR4CG were ruled out for quadrupole transitions; intensity balances

217FR6CG multipolarities.

217RA C  The level scheme is presented as constructed by 1984Ro20,              
217RA2C  1984Su10, and 1987SuZY. Some differences between the schemes shown by  
217RA3C  1984Su10 and 1984Ro20 have been corrected in 1987SuZY, a later report  
217RA4C  by the authors of 1984Su10. The levels above the 4187-KEV level and    
217RA5C  levels at 1971, 2305, 2740, 2802, 2830, 3256, 3600, and 3605 KEV were  
217RA6C  proposed in 1987SuZY.                                                  
217RA C  The level scheme given by 1983Lo16 disagrees with those of 1984Ro20

217RA2CG 1984Ro20, and 1984Su10, and CE data of 1984Ro20. The quadrupole

217RA CG           1984Su10 observed a 197-KEV |g in coincidence with the       
217RA2CG 197|g, indicating that the 197-KEV peak is a doublet. This component   
217RA3CG was placed to feed the 13/2+ at 540 KEV from the 15/2+ state which was 
217RA4CG proposed to be at 737 KEV deexcited by the 600.3|g. These placements   
217RA5CG would require the 539.6|g to be in coincidence with the 600.3|g. This  
217RA6CG transition, however, is absent in the authors' spectrum shown as       
217RA7CG taken in coincidence with the 540|g. In their later work where the     
217RA8CG placements of 600.3 and 406.4 gammas were corrected,no second 197|g

217RA CG M         EKC=0.07 3 (1984Ro20) suggests E2 multipolarity with         
217RA2CG M1 admixture. However, the angular distribution implies a dipole       
217RA3CG nature. The intensity balance at the 1896.4-KEV level is:              
217RA4CG TI(404.7|g)-TI(228.9|g)=0 16,if 404.7|g is E2; -26 18, if it is M1.

217RA6CG reversed order, on the other hand, would make the balance at the

217AC8DA The uncertainty can actually be reduced by arguing that r0(219Ac)

217AC C  Decay scheme is presented basically as constructed by 1985De14 from    
217AC2C  their |g-|g and |g-ce coincidences. In the level scheme shown by       
217AC3C  1982Go14 orders of the 478.9 and 349.0 gammas were reversed, and       
217AC4C  a level at 1019 KEV was introduced between these cascading gammas.     
217AC5C  Their (486.4|g)(|g) coincidence spectrum shown, however, indicates     
217AC6C  the presence of the 349.0|g and absence of the 478.9|g. Gamma's        
217AC7C  observed at 501.6, 371.7, 380, and 327.6 KEV were placed by 1982GoZU   
217AC8C  in cascade to deexcite proposed levels at 3263, 2762, 2390 and 2010,   
217AC9C  respectively. These levels and GAMMA placements are assumed            
217AC2C  here as preliminary results.                                           
217AC CG E         Measured energies of 1985De14 were listed without their      
217AC2CG uncertainties and, presumably, in rounded-off values. Since E|g's of   
217AC3CG 1982GoZU agree with those of 1985De14, measurements of 1982GoZU are    
217AC4CG given here, unless otherwise noted. Uncertainties on E|g's are         
217AC5CG estimated by the evaluator to be less than 0.5 KEV for the strong |g   
217AC6CG transitions.                                                           
217AC CG RI        Relative photon intensities measured by 1985De14. If photon  
217AC2CG intensities are renormalized to per 100 |a decays of the {+217}Ac      
217AC3CG g.s., TI(660G)+TI(670G)=I(9650A), a factor of NR=0.98 9 is obtained.   
217AC CG M         From CE measurements and angular distribution data of        
217AC2CG 1985De14. The CE intensities given were normalized by using the        
217AC3CG theoretical conversion coefficients for the 220-KEV GAMMA.
