268  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
268  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
268  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
268  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
268  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
268  6c  any element.                                                           
268  !c                                                                         
268  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
268  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
268  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
268  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
268  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
268  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
268  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
268  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
268  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
268  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
268  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
268  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
268  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
268  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
268  #c                                                                         
268  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
268  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
268  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
268  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
268  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
268  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
268  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
268  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
268  #c                                                                         
268  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
268  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
268  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
268  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
268  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

268  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
268  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
268  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
268  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
268  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

268  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
268  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
268  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
268  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
268  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
268  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
268  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
268  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
268  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
268  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
268  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
268  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

268  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
268  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
268  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
268  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
268  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
268  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
268  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
268  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
268  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
268  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
268  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
268  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
268  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
268  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
268  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
268  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
268  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
268  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
268  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
268  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
268  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
268  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
268  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
268  Oc  face competition from fission.

268  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
268  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
268  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
268  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
268  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
268  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
268  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
268  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
268  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
268  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

268  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
268  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
268  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
268  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
268  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
268  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
268  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

268  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
268  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
268  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

268  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator) 
268  ac  is much larger than that observed by 2004Og12 and                      
268  Bc  2004OgZZ (15 data points, using DGFRS), although the E|a is in

268  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

268  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
268  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
268  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
268  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
268  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
268  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
268  #c                                                                         
268  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
268  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
268  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
268  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
268  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
268  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
268  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
268  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
268  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
268  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
268  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
268  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
268  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
268  #c                                                                         
268  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
268  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
268  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
268  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
268  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
268  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
268  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
268  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
268  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
268  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
268  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

268  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
268  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
268  3c  of the various arguments put                                           
268  3c  forward therein, the following comments may be made here:              
268  #c                                                                         
268  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
268  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
268  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
268  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
268  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
268  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
268  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
268  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
268  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
268  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
268  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
268  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
268  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
268  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
268  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

268  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
268  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
268  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
268  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
268  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
268  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
268  #c                                                                         
268  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
268  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
268  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
268  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
268  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
268  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
268  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
268  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
268  !c                                                                         
268  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
268  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

268  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
268  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
268  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
268  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
268  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
268  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

268DB9C  247 MEV WITH AN AVERAGE INTENSITY OF 5E+12 IONS/SEC. RECOILS FROM THE  
268DBAC  REACTION PRODUCTS WERE PASSED THROUGH A COLLIMATOR AND STOPPED IN A    
268DBBC  COPPER CATCHER 50 MM IN DIAMETER WITH AN ESTIMATED COLLECTION          
268DBCC  EFFICIENCY OF CLOSE TO 100%. A TOTAL OF 8 IDENTICAL RUNS WERE MADE     
268DBDC  OVER 20 TO 45 HOURS. FOLLOWING EACH IRRADIATION AND AFTER CLEANING,    
268DBEC  MICRO-CUTS OF THE UPPER LAYER WERE RADIOCHEMICALLY ANALYZED FOR Group  
268DBFC  ^V ELEMENTS AFTER DISSOLVING THESE MICRO-LAYERS IN A SOLUTION OF

268DB2C  THE NINTH EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS BUT WITH 
268DB3C  NO CHEMICAL SEPARATION OF PRODUCTS, TO DETERMINE SF BACKGROUND.        
268DB4C  AN ANALYSIS OF ALL DATA LEAD TO THE UNAMBIGUOUS CONCLUSION THAT ALL    
268DB5C  15 EVENTS WERE DUE TO 268DB. DEDUCED CROSS-SECTION: AP 4 pb IN         
268DB6C  REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH ^DGFRS VALUE FOR 3{IN} CHANNEL AP 3 pb.

268DB8C  TO AP 35% USING KINEMATIC TECHNIQUES (^DGFRS, 2004OG03).               
268DB C  THE EVALUATORS SUGGEST THAT THIS EXPERIMENT OFFERS INDEPENDENT         
268DB2C  SUPPORT FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF Z=115 AND ITS DECAY PRODUCTS AS           
268DB3C  SUGGESTED BY THIS COLLABORATION IN 2004OG03.

268DB5C  THIS METHOD IS A FACTOR OF 5 HIGHER THAN THAT REALIZED BY KINEMATIC    
268DB6C  TECHNIQUES.
